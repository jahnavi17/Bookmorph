        "]\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving\nby allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies\nto books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very\nnumerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it\nbrings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by",
        "allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that",
        "of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might",
        "very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\nnot want them._\n\n_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present",
        "book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,",
        "I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\ncause._\n\n_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and",
        "finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident",
        "could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the",
        "hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to",
        "be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or",
        "garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._\n\n_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest",
        "merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot",
        "acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still",
        "superior to them._\n\n_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,",
        "obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those",
        "who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,",
        "of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected",
        "Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous",
        "falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is",
        "a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._\n\n_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed",
        "that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should",
        "myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a",
        "single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when",
        "ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey",
        "even in a black one._\n\n_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any",
        "Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.",
        "Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\nto Addison in others._",
        "_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and",
        "distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.",
        "Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled",
        "with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\nare historically true._\n\n_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me",
        "very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present",
        "themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of",
        "the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his",
        "consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the",
        "result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\noutside of these four._\n\n_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties",
        "difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has",
        "taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings",
        "in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._",
        "_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in",
        "drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._\n\n_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into",
        "comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s",
        "scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really",
        "injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\ncharm._\n\n_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_",
        "allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and",
        "secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,",
        "as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have",
        "been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._\n\n_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a",
        "certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea",
        "that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have",
        "married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\nCruscans of this._\n\n_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In",
        "the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\nGrant.

        "to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.”\n\n“What is his name?”\n\n“Bingley.”\n\n“Is he married or single?”\n\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\n\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\n\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”",
        "“Is that his design in settling here?”\n\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.”\n\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.”\n\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but",
        "I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\n\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\n\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.”\n\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\n\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,",
        "merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.”\n\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\n\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the",
        "others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\n\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.”\n\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”",
        "“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.”\n\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\n\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\n\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\nvisit them.”\n\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.”",
        "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.",

He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following",
        "manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\n\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\n\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\n\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\n\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces",
        "of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\nof her.”\n\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\nnot depend on her serving you.”\n\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\n\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\nthem ill.”",
        "“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\n\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\n\n“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\nshe will not know him herself.”\n\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\n\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him",
        "myself; how can you be so teasing?”\n\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\nwill take it on myself.”\n\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\nnonsense!”",
        "“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\ngreat books, and make extracts.”\n\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\nBingley.”",
        "“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\n\n“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\n\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy",
        "was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\nwhile.\n\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\nword about it till now.”\n\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,",
        "as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n\n“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\nball.”",
        "“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\ndinner.\n\n[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “He rode a black horse”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her",
        "husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\nin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly",
        "with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\n\n“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\n\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten",
        "minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\n\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her",
        "housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a",
        "little by starting the idea of his\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “When the Party entered”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,",
        "his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention",
        "of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be",
        "proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\nfriend.\n\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for",
        "themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of",
        "his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\n\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\nMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\nfriend to join it.\n\n“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you",
        "standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\ndance.”\n\n“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\nwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\nstand up with.”\n\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a",
        "kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\nlife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\nuncommonly pretty.”\n\n“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”",
        "[Illustration:\n\n“She is tolerable”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”",
        "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\n\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been",
        "distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they",
        "were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\nhad a very different story to hear.\n\n“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most",
        "delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody",
        "can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\n\n“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of",
        "his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\n\n“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”\n\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch",
        "of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\n“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my",
        "dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\nshe admired him.\n\n“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\nwith such perfect good breeding!”",
        "“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\n\n“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\ndid not expect such a compliment.”\n\n“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help",
        "seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\nstupider person.”\n\n“Dear Lizzy!”\n\n“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”",
        "“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\nwhat I think.”\n\n“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing",
        "of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”\n\n“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.”\n\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more",
        "quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the",
        "habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\nacquired by trade.\n\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred",
        "thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.",
        "His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an",
        "hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\n\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley",
        "had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\ngiving offence.\n\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently",
        "characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had",
        "felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\nmuch.\n\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.",
        "[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a",
        "disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,",
        "friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\ncourteous.\n\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.\n\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly",
        "brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n\n“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”\n\n“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\n\n“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\nabout Mr. Robinson.”",
        "“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\n\n“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as",
        "if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\n\n“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”\n\n“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he",
        "sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”\n\n[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\n“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\n\n“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\nspoke to.”\n\n“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless",
        "among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\nagreeable.”\n\n“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”\n\n“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”",
        "“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\nif I were you.”\n\n“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”\n\n“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\nto be proud.”",
        "“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\n\n“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some",
        "quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\n\n“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”",
        "“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\ndirectly.”\n\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the",
        "good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,",
        "in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an",
        "uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\nLucas.\n\n“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the",
        "dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”",
        "“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\ndiscover it too.”\n\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\n\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\nit, he must find it out.”\n\n“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they",
        "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\nin love as much as she chooses.”\n\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined",
        "to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\nenough to make her understand his character.”",
        "“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\nevenings may do a great deal.”\n\n“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”",
        "“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to",
        "have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\nlife.”\n\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\n\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely",
        "allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry",
        "in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\nto dance with.\n\nHe began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing",
        "with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\nassembled.\n\n“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”\n\n“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\n\n“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by",
        "being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\n\n[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George\nAllen._]]\n\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\nturned to him and said,--\n\n“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well",
        "just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\nMeryton?”\n\n“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\nenergetic.”\n\n“You are severe on us.”\n\n“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\n\n“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a",
        "musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”",
        "Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\nimpatient for display.\n\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her",
        "application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in",
        "dancing at one end of the room.\n\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\n\n“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\nrefinements of polished societies.”",
        "“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\n\nSir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\n\n“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\n\n“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”",
        "“Never, sir.”\n\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\n\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\n\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\n\nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\n“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”\n\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to",
        "make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\nher,--\n\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though",
        "extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\n\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\n\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.",
        "“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\nfor one half hour.”\n\n“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\n\n“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\npartner?”",
        "Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\n\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\n\n“I should imagine not.”\n\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the",
        "noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\n\n“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\n\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.",
        "Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\n\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\n\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\njoy?”\n\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\n\n“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as",
        "absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\n\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “A note for Miss Bennet”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two",
        "thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\n\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.",
        "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning",
        "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\nthe head-quarters.\n\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting",
        "intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\nan ensign.",
        "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\nBennet coolly observed,--\n\n“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\nI am now convinced.”\n\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\nnext morning to London.",
        "“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\n\n“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\n\n“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\n\n“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must",
        "so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\nfoolish.”\n\n“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,",
        "should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\nhis regimentals.”\n\n“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\n\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a",
        "note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\n\n“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\n\n“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n\n     /* NIND “My dear friend, */\n\n     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and",
        "me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\n     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\n     Yours ever,\n\n“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”\n\n“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\n_that_.”\n\n“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”\n\n“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.",
        "“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”\n\n“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\nthey would not offer to send her home.”\n\n“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\n\n“I had much rather go in the coach.”\n\n“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”",
        "[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]\n\n“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\n\n“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\nwill be answered.”\n\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it",
        "rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\nJane certainly could not come back.\n\n“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--",
        "/* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\n\n     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\n\n“Yours, etc.”",
        "“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\n\n“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\ncarriage.”",
        "Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n\n“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\nthere.”\n\n“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\n\n“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\nhorses?”",
        "“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\n\n“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\n\n“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\ntogether.",
        "“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\nsee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\n\nIn Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\nof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\nover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\nwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face",
        "glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n\nShe was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their",
        "brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\nthinking only of his breakfast.\n\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss",
        "Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the",
        "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\nher.\n\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice",
        "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\nnothing to do elsewhere.\n\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern",
        "at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\nback a supply of clothes.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The Apothecary came”\n]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“covering a screen”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six",
        "Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their",
        "indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\n\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was",
        "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:",
        "she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\nthought the same, and added,--\n\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\nlooked almost wild.”\n\n“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”",
        "“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\nhide it not doing its office.”\n\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\nescaped my notice.”\n\n“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am",
        "inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\nan exhibition.”\n\n“Certainly not.”\n\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\nBingley.",
        "“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\neyes.”\n\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\n\n“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no",
        "chance of it.”\n\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\nMeryton?”\n\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\n\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\n\n“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”\n\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.",
        "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.\n\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and",
        "when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n\n“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”",
        "“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\n\n“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\n\n“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\n\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table",
        "where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\nothers; all that his library afforded.\n\n“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever looked into.”\n\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\nin the room.\n\n“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at",
        "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\n\n“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\ngenerations.”\n\n“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\nbooks.”\n\n“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\nthese.”\n\n“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”\n\n“I wish it may.”",
        "“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”\n\n“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\n\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\n\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\n\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little",
        "attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.\n\n“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\nshe be as tall as I am?”\n\n“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\nrather taller.”\n\n“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me",
        "so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\n\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”\n\n“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\n\n“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am",
        "sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”\n\n“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my",
        "acquaintance that are really accomplished.”\n\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\n\n“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\nidea of an accomplished woman.”\n\n“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\n\n“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,",
        "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\nwill be but half deserved.”\n\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\nreading.”\n\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.",
        "I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\n\n“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\nthis?”\n\n“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\n\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with",
        "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\nroom.\n\n“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\nsex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\nsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”",
        "“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\ndespicable.”\n\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\ncontinue the subject.\n\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for",
        "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\nunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,",
        "however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\npossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\nM^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the",
        "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\nown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her",
        "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think",
        "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\nBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n\n“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\na little longer on your kindness.”",
        "“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\nsure, will not hear of her removal.”\n\n“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\nremains with us.”\n\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n\n“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a",
        "vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\ntemper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\n_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\nover that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\nequal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\nhope, though you have but a short lease.”",
        "“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\n\n“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\n\n“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\n\n“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”\n\n“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\nthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”",
        "“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\n\n“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\n\n“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\na studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\n\n“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\nleast that advantage.”",
        "“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\nunvarying society.”\n\n“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\nobserved in them for ever.”\n\n“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\ncountry neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\ngoing on in the country as in town.”",
        "Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\nvictory over him, continued her triumph,--\n\n“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\n\n“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and",
        "when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\n\n“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\ngentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\nat all.”\n\n“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\nmother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which",
        "you must acknowledge to be true.”\n\n“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\n\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of",
        "saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\n\n“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\ngenteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\nimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”",
        "“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\n\n“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\nCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”",
        "“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\n\n“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\nof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\npartiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\nbrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my",
        "sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\nBut, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\n\n“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\n\n“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.",
        "“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\n\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to",
        "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\nindeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\neach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the",
        "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her",
        "own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\nball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\nto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\n\n“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of",
        "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”\n\nLydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\nwait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\nadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”\n\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned",
        "instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\nall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who",
        "continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in",
        "attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n\n“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\n\nHe made no answer.\n\n“You write uncommonly fast.”\n\n“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”",
        "“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”\n\n“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”\n\n“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\n\n“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\n\n“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\npens remarkably well.”\n\n“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”\n\n“How can you contrive to write so even?”\n\nHe was silent.",
        "“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\nGrantley’s.”\n\n“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.”\n\n“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”",
        "“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\nto determine.”\n\n“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\nease cannot write ill.”\n\n“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\nbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much\nfor words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\n\n“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\n\n“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way",
        "imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\n\n“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”\n\n“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”\n\n“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\nindirect boast.”",
        "“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”\n\n“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.",
        "Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\n\n“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I",
        "believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”\n\n“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay",
        "till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.”\n\n“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\nmore than he did himself.”\n\n“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means",
        "intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\ncircumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.”\n\n“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\n\n“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for\nhimself.”\n\n“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to",
        "stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\none argument in favour of its propriety.”\n\n“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\nwith you.”\n\n“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\neither.”\n\n“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of",
        "friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no",
        "very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\n\n“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?”\n\n“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more",
        "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\nknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\nwhen he has nothing to do.”\n\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was",
        "rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\n\n“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\nand want to silence this.”\n\n“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”",
        "“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.”\n\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\nfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\nthe pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\nway, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\nseated herself.",
        "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\nadmiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\nhe disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her",
        "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\n\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\nElizabeth, said to her,--\n\n“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\nopportunity of dancing a reel?”",
        "She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\nsurprise at her silence.\n\n“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell",
        "you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\ndare.”\n\n“Indeed I do not dare.”\n\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\nbelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\nshould be in some danger.",
        "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\n\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\n\n“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\nnext day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this",
        "desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\nand if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after\nthe officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\nwhich your lady possesses.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “No, no; stay where you are”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”",
        "“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\nlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”\n\n“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\ncopied.”",
        "At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\nElizabeth herself.\n\n“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\n\n“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without\ntelling us that you were coming out.”\n\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\nand immediately said,--",
        "“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\navenue.”\n\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\nlaughingly answered,--\n\n“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\nfourth. Good-bye.”\n\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered",
        "as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Piling up the fire”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\nseeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\nwhere she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\npleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were",
        "during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\nof conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\nwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\nacquaintance with spirit.\n\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\nMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed",
        "himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\nand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\nattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\ndoor. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.",
        "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\ndelight.\n\nWhen tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\nDarcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\nsilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\nHurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the",
        "sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\nrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\nBennet.\n\nMiss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\nDarcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\nperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her",
        "question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\nan excellent library.”",
        "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\ntowards him and said,--\n\n“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not",
        "some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\npleasure.”\n\n“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\nchooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\nthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\nround my cards.”\n\n“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably",
        "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\nday.”\n\n“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\nnear so much like a ball.”\n\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the",
        "desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\nturning to Elizabeth, said,--\n\n“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\nlong in one attitude.”\n\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as",
        "Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\ninterfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\nmeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\n\n“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be",
        "severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\nnothing about it.”\n\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\nanything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\ntwo motives.\n\n“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\nas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\nthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret",
        "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\ncompletely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\nas I sit by the fire.”\n\n“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\n\n“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate",
        "as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\n\n“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\nyet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\nno; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\nDarcy may hug himself.”\n\n“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an",
        "uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\nlaugh.”\n\n“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\nwisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\nbe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\njoke.”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am",
        "not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\nand nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\nlaugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\nyou are without.”\n\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\nunderstanding to ridicule.”\n\n“Such as vanity and pride.”\n\n“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real",
        "superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”\n\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n\n“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\n“and pray what is the result?”\n\n“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\nhimself without disguise.”\n\n“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch",
        "for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\never.”\n\n“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I",
        "really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\n\n“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\n\n“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\n\n“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\nthem.”\n\n“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr. Hurst.”",
        "Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\nnext morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\nthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on",
        "her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\nwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\nleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very",
        "well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\ncontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\n\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was",
        "said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\nJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\n\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where",
        "she felt herself to be right.\n\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\nBingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\nwisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\nshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been",
        "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\n\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\nall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last",
        "very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.\n\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much",
        "trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\nanimation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\nElizabeth.\n\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human",
        "nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of\nthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\nfor them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said\nin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\nhad dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it\nhad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\nbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”\n\n“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”\n\n“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”",
        "Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\nBingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly\nthing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.\nBut--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got\nto-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this\nmoment.”\n\n“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.”",
        "This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\neagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\n\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\nexplained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a\nfortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,\nand requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\npleases.”",
        "“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\nchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\nto do something or other about it.”\n\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\nThey had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.",
        "Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\n\n“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”",
        "“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\nfriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\ndid before him?”\n\n“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\nhead, as you will hear.”\n\n     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */\n\n“Dear Sir,\n\n     “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured",

        "conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will\nprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\nindulgent as to let him come to us again.”\n\n“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\ndiscourage him.”\n\n“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean\nto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\ncredit.”",
        "Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady\nCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.\n\n“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There\nis something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by\napologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would\nhelp it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”",
        "“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\nletter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”\n\n“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem\ndefective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\nthink it is well expressed.”\n\nTo Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any",
        "degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\nastonished her husband and daughters.\n\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great",
        "politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,\nheavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this",
        "instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\nBennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--\n\n“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\noddly.”\n\n“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”",
        "“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,\nI know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.”\n\n“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come",
        "prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,\nwhen we are better acquainted----”\n\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his",
        "own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\nhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a",
        "quarter of an hour.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen",
        "better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,",
        "and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\ntwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to",
        "marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.\n\n“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”",
        "“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\nfrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”\n\n“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”\n\n“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\nextensive property.”\n\n“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”\n\n“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says",
        "that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\naccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends",
        "to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\n\n“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\ncourt.”\n\n“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\nthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to",
        "offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\npay.”\n\n“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you",
        "that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?”\n\n“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.”",
        "Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\nas he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\nin his pleasure.\n\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,\nglad to invite him\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Protested",
        "that he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94\n]\n\nto read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\nwas produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be\nfrom a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,\nprotested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\nexclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\nchose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and",
        "before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\ninterrupted him with,--\n\n“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away\nRichard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”\n\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--",
        "“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\nme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”\n\nThen, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.",
        "Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\nfor backgammon.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had",
        "been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\nhad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in",
        "retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",
        "Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\npart.",
        "His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\nof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at",
        "Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\n_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to\nhint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”\n\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon",
        "done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.\n\nLydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,",
        "at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told",
        "Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\ngo.\n\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of",
        "the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\nwere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\na shop window, could recall them.\n\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very",
        "Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\nhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\nto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\nsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\npavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to",
        "introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a",
        "readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on",
        "purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.",
        "What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.\n\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.",
        "Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\ninvitation.\n\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had",
        "told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to",
        "her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham",
        "appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips",
        "protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.\n\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or",
        "both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\nbehaviour than her sister.\n\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\nPhilips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although",
        "utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\naunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach",
        "conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\nthe house.\n\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he",
        "might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison",
        "with the housekeeper’s room.\n\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as",
        "soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\nThe gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The",
        "officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The officers of the ----shire”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was",
        "turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.\n\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young",
        "ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.\n\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\n\n“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.",
        "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore",
        "at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.",
        "“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.”\n\n“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”\n\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.",
        "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\n\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.”\n\n“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him",
        "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\n\n“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”",
        "“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\n\n“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\nill-tempered man.”\n\nWickham only shook his head.",
        "“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\nlikely to be in this country much longer.”\n\n“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\n\n“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,",
        "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been",
        "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\nmemory of his father.”\n\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he",
        "had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.\n\n“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.",
        "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.”\n\n“Indeed!”",
        "“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.”\n\n“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”\n\n“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to",
        "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done",
        "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”\n\n“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\n\n“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”",
        "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\never as he expressed them.\n\n“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”\n\n“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had",
        "not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\nof preference which was often given me.”\n\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\nthis!”\n\nAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_",
        "remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\nmust be dreadful.”\n\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\nhardly be just to him.”\n\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very",
        "countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\nmanner.”\n\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,",
        "appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it",
        "to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”\n\n“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.”\n\n“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has",
        "connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.”\n\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\n\n“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his",
        "father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”\n\n“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”",
        "He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her",
        "education.”\n\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\n\n“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\nknow Mr. Bingley?”\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\nDarcy is.”",
        "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\nnever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\nsincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\nsomething for fortune and figure.”",
        "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;",
        "that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.\n\n“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\nlittle matters.”",
        "Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.\n\n“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\n\n“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy",
        "were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”\n\n“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.”\n\n“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\n\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her",
        "affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\nself-destined to another.\n\n“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\nLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\nher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\n\n“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have",
        "not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.”",
        "Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\nWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\nMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could",
        "think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing",
        "that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “delighted to see their dear friend again”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\nBingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the",
        "veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\ndone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\notherwise explained.\n\n“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or",
        "other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\nwithout actual blame on either side.”\n\n“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\nbusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\nsomebody.”",
        "“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\nmanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”",
        "“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\nMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\nnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\nso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”\n\n“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\nthink.”\n\n“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”\n\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.",
        "Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\nthe affair became public.\n\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see",
        "their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.",
        "The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.",
        "Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\nhad no disinclination for it.",
        "“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\neverybody.”\n\nElizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he",
        "did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\ndance.\n\n“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing",
        "myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.”\n\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins",
        "instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a",
        "quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose",
        "to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No",
        "aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than",
        "might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,--",
        "“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”\n\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to",
        "the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\n\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her",
        "spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a",
        "disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\nrelease from him was ecstasy.\n\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without",
        "knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.\n\n“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\n\n“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\nevil.”\n\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her",
        "hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to",
        "imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\nwith--\n\n“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the",
        "dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\nroom, or the number of couples.”\n\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid.\n\n“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\n_now_ we may be silent.”\n\n“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\n\n“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be",
        "entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”\n\n“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”\n\n“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say",
        "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\n\n“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\n\n“I must not decide on my own performance.”\n\nHe made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often",
        "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”\n\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,--\n\n“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his",
        "_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.”\n\n“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.”\n\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.",
        "Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\nhis dancing and his partner.\n\n“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing",
        "at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Such very superior dancing is not\noften seen.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir",
        "William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--\n\n“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\nof.”\n\n“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for",
        "themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\n\n“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\n\n“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.”\n\n“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\n\n“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.”",
        "“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\nwith a look of doubt.\n\n“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\nby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\nthat you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_?”\n\n“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.",
        "“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\n\n“I hope not.”\n\n“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”\n\n“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\n\n“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\n\n“And what is your success?”\n\nShe shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”",
        "“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\n\n“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.”\n\n“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in",
        "silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother.\n\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--\n\n“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand",
        "questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\nother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\nDarcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a",
        "most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this",
        "discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”\n\n“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\nassure you, he informed me himself.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”",
        "“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.",
        "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\n\n“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”",
        "“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his",
        "sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\nregard.”\n\n“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\n\n“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\n\n“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\n\n“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard",
        "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim _conditionally_ only.”\n\n“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”",
        "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,",
        "and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\nas to make a most important discovery.\n\n“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would",
        "have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\n\n“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\n\n“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.",
        "I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\nassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\n\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in",
        "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\nthe determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\nspeaking, replied thus,--\n\n“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those",
        "which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\nsame time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\ndictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\nwhat I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\nyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,",
        "though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\nyourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”",
        "“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\nunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\nreplied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.",
        "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n\n“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",
        "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\nher perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\nvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring",
        "even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\nsaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\nlest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\nshe considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\none of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\ntalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\nelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.",
        "Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\nof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\na charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\nwere the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\ncomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\ncertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as",
        "Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\nand, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\nconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\nnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\nto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\noccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She",
        "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it.\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.",
        "“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\nso doing.”\n\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and",
        "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\nsteady gravity.\n\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who",
        "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of",
        "complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\nElizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\nshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute",
        "began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\nShe looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,",
        "and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\n\n“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\n\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n\n“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I",
        "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not",
        "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who",
        "should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\nconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\nroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\nLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",
        "To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should",
        "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with",
        "somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\nroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\nto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\nhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\nclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\nproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\noften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\nto herself.",
        "She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\nit.\n\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\nmanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\nhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how",
        "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and",
        "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\nhow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.",
        "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to",
        "go the next day for a short time.\n\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.",
        "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “to assure you in the most animated language”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as",
        "his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--\n\n“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,",
        "when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\ncourse of this morning?”\n\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\nBennet instantly answered,--\n\n“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\nshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,--\n\n“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse",
        "me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\ngoing away myself.”\n\n“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\nMr. Collins.”\n\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it",
        "over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--\n\n“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little",
        "unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\nmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for",
        "marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\n\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\nhe continued,--\n\n“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example",
        "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\nvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\nhave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was",
        "arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and",
        "kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I",
        "assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I",
        "flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,",
        "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\n\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n\n“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\nthem.”",
        "“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\n\n“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an",
        "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the",
        "situation.”\n\n“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\nvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.”\n\n“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of",
        "believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\naddressed her,--",
        "“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.”",
        "“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.”\n\n“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand",
        "is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer\nwould be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my\nconnections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your\nown, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\nfurther consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\nby no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\nYour portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo",
        "the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\n\n“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you",
        "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\ntruth from her heart.”\n\n“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\ngallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express",
        "authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\nbeing acceptable.”\n\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could",
        "not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in",
        "warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\n\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been",
        "glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\nand could not help saying so.\n\n“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\na very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will _make_ her know it.”\n\n“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she",
        "is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\n\n“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is",
        "only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\n\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--\n\n“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will",
        "not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have _her_.”\n\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.\n\n“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\nfinished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\n\n“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,",
        "and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\n\n“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”\n\n“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.”\n\n“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\n\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\nlibrary.\n\n“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made",
        "you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”\n\nElizabeth replied that it was.\n\n“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\n\n“I have, sir.”\n\n“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\n\n“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\n\n“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you",
        "again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you _do_.”\n\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n\n“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\n\n“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.",
        "First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\npresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.”\n\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\nher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined",
        "interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\n\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her",
        "deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\n\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\nher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “they entered the breakfast room”\n]",
        "Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her\nfamily. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;\n“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,",
        "nobody feels for my poor nerves.”\n\nCharlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\n\n“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as\nmay be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she\ncan have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is",
        "to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it",
        "is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\n\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\nattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\nthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--\n\n“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and",
        "let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”\n\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\nconversation:--",
        "“Oh, Mr. Collins!”\n\n“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\nFar be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\ndispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\ninevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\nwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\ntrust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my",
        "positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\nfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\ndaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.",
        "My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\ndismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\nby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\nstiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\nher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of",
        "himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\nespecially to her friend.\n\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\nSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.",
        "After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\naunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\n\n“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet",
        "Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\n\nShe highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.",
        "His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the\ncompliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\n\n[Illustration: “Walked back with them”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\nfrom Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s",
        "fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\nJane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they",
        "had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\nfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\nto town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\nwhat she says.”\n\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,",
        "and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\nregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\nmeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these",
        "high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.\n\n“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be",
        "able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.”\n\n“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.",
        "“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest",
        "friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\nwhom we shall deprive you.’\n\n“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\nwinter.”\n\n“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”",
        "“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still",
        "more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s",
        "partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\nJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;",
        "that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\nsubject?”\n\n“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”\n\n“Most willingly.”\n\n“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to",
        "town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.”\n\nJane shook her head.\n\n“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she",
        "is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest",
        "degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”\n\n“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.”",
        "“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\n\n“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?”\n\n“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is",
        "more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\nby all means, to refuse him.”\n\n“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.”\n\n“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.”\n\n“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months.”",
        "The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of everyone.\n\nShe represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.",
        "Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.\n\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen",
        "to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\ncare to have two full courses.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\nhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”\n\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth",
        "had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next",
        "morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His",
        "reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\nthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that",
        "was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\nestablishment were gained.",
        "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\ninterest than the matter had ever\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “So much love and eloquence”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]",
        "excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\nSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\nexpedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\nJames’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved",
        "from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable",
        "provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and",
        "probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct",
        "questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\npublish his prosperous love.\n\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\nthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\nmoved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\ncordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,",
        "whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\n\n“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\npossible.”\n\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\nso speedy a return, immediately said,--\n\n“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my",
        "good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\noffending your patroness.”\n\n“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”\n\n“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us",
        "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”\n\n“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\nthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall",
        "now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”\n\nWith proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\nsurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a",
        "solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her",
        "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\nas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\nshe could not help crying out,--\n\n“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\n\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her",
        "story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\nher composure, and calmly replied,--\n\n“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\n\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort",
        "for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\nwished her all imaginable happiness.\n\n“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never",
        "was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state.”\n\nElizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It",
        "was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a",
        "most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\nshe had chosen.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what",
        "she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always",
        "unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--\n\n“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\n\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.",
        "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character",
        "of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\n\nMrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two",
        "inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William",
        "or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.\n\nMr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\nmore foolish than his daughter!\n\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said",
        "less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\nto spread at Meryton.\n\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\nMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she",
        "called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\nthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\nenough to drive happiness away.\n\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her",
        "sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\n\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a",
        "twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\ndischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\nwith many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\naffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\nthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\nLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;",
        "for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\nshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\nbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\nday for making him the happiest of men.\n\nMr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come",
        "to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\nabsence.\n\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the",
        "report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\nfalsehood.\n\nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its",
        "frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\nthe strength of his attachment.\n\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\npainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\nconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject",
        "was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\ndid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\nJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\ntranquillity.\n\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his",
        "first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”\n]\n\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of",
        "anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself",
        "and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\n\n“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\nto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”\n\n“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”",
        "This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.\n\n“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”\n\n“What should not you mind?”\n\n“I should not mind anything at all.”\n\n“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.”\n\n“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How",
        "anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\ndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”\n\n“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMiss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for",
        "the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country.\n\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline",
        "boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\n\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern",
        "for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to",
        "the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;",
        "whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\n\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\nnot help saying,--",
        "“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\nall be as we were before.”\n\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.\n\n“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my",
        "acquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”\n\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.”\n\n“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness",
        "and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\ndeserve.”\n\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.\n\n“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be",
        "afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,",
        "the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\nis unaccountable!”\n\n“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\nsituation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and\nCharlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be",
        "ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\nregard and esteem for our cousin.”\n\n“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as",
        "I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\ndanger security for happiness.”\n\n“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied",
        "Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but",
        "our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\nit does.”\n\n“And men take care that they should.”\n\n“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”\n\n“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”\nsaid Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\nunhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,",
        "want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,\nwill do the business.”\n\n“And do you impute it to either of those?”\n\n“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I\nthink of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”\n\n“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\n\n“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\n\n“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can",
        "only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\nsecure it.”\n\n“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\nhappiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\nconnections, and pride.”\n\n“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;\n“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have",
        "known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\nthey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most",
        "unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”\n\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\n\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no",
        "more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\nwith less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at",
        "the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\ncomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\n\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\nto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\nthen. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to",
        "be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\nbe your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\n\n“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\nall expect Jane’s good fortune.”\n\n“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\nalways make the most of it.”",
        "Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they",
        "had known anything of the matter.\n\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\nextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\nHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.",
        "Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\nside by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to\nhope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\nof his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\nhis fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father",
        "another letter of thanks.\n\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\nbrother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at\nLongbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so",
        "well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\nwoman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two\neldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\n\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was",
        "done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\nin it.\n\n“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.\nBingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think",
        "that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\nmuch entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted",
        "so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of\nlong sleeves.”\n\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\nconversation.",
        "When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\n“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I\nam sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,\nsuch as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\ngirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\nforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Offended two or three young ladies”",
        "[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\nlove with only a few days before.”\n\n“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as",
        "often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\nMr. Bingley’s love?”\n\n“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\nspoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be",
        "finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”\n\n“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\nbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\nservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\nanything.”",
        "Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\nof her sister’s ready acquiescence.\n\n“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.”\n\n“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his",
        "friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\npart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\nperhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\nwould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\nnever stirs without him.”\n\n“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane",
        "correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”\n\n“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\n\nBut, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that",
        "his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s\nattractions.\n\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she\nhoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she\nmight occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\nseeing him.",
        "The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\nmade part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\non these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s",
        "warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\nan attachment.\n\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,",
        "before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\nof Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\nthe death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been\nin the way of procuring.\n\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by",
        "character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible\nsubject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\nthe minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\ntribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\ndelighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\npresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\nthat gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might",
        "agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having\nheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,\nill-natured boy.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Will you come and see me?”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on\nthe first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--",
        "“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\nare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\nyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\nfortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\n_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you",
        "must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\n\n“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\n\n“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\n\n“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\ncan prevent it.”",
        "“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\n\n“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\nof it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My",
        "father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\nsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\nseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\nof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\nit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is",
        "not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\nfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\nshort, I will do my best.”\n\n“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\noften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”\n\n“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine",
        "that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\nare satisfied.”\n\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice\nbeing given on such a point without being resented.",
        "Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the\nLucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His\nmarriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned\nas to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured\ntone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the\nwedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and",
        "when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\naccompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,\nCharlotte said,--\n\n“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\n\n“_That_ you certainly shall.”\n\n“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”\n\n“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\n\n“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to",
        "come to Hunsford.”\n\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\nvisit.\n\n“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and\nI hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be\nas welcome to me as either of them.”\n\nThe wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\nthe church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the\nsubject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their",
        "correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it\nshould be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;\nand, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\nsake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would",
        "like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most\nfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and",
        "Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\nfor her own visit there, to know the rest.\n\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\n\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\ngenerally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or",
        "hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\nher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\nlost.\n\n“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\n\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\n“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very",
        "glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\nto London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.\nI inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\nengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\nsoon see them here.”",
        "Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.\n\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\nblind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet",
        "more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\nwill prove what she felt:--\n\n     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\n     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have\n     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my\n     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me",
        "obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\n     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she\n     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she",
        "made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\n     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\n     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\n     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been",
        "acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\n     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all",
        "cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\n     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\n     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful",
        "thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\n     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear\n     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never\n     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\n     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely\n     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at\n     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am",
        "sure you will be very comfortable there.\n\n“Yours, etc.”\n\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\neven wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every\nreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.",
        "Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly\nregret what he had thrown away.\n\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had\nsuch to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to",
        "see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\nin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.",
        "Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\nsincerely wish him happy.\n\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the\ncircumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that",
        "pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\nand wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\ntowards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think\nher a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more\ninteresting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love",
        "with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways\nof the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the\nplain.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “On the Stairs”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise",
        "diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the\nplan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater\npleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire\nof seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.",
        "There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give\nher a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of",
        "spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as\nperfect as plan could be.\n\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\n\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that",
        "Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\nwas a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,",
        "whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\nand pleasing.\n\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think\nhim less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but",
        "she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\nworn out, like his information.\n\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when\nthey entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,",
        "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\nwhose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",
        "Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\nhope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and",
        "herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance.\n\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\n\n“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\n\n“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,",
        "and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\nmercenary.”\n\n“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\nwhat to think.”\n\n“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”\n\n“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death\nmade her mistress of this fortune?”",
        "“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\npoor?”\n\n“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so\nsoon after this event.”\n\n“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\nwhy should _we_?”",
        "“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”\n\n“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\n\n“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”\n\n“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in",
        "Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\nneither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\nworth knowing, after all.”\n\n“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”\n\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the",
        "unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\n\n“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\nGardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”\n\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear\naunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me",
        "fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men\nto rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And\nwhen we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where\nwe have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,\nand rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when\nwe attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling",
        "about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less\ninsupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “At the door”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nEvery object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.",
        "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\nThe paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte",
        "appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\ncoming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\ninstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:",
        "his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\nin the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\nformality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\noffers of refreshment.",
        "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\neverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\nthat she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.",
        "Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\nwhich certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\nCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\nevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\nfender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the",
        "garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\nwhich he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out",
        "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\nthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\nthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\nbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\nhandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.",
        "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which",
        "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\nCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\nforgotten.\n\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\nin, observed,--\n\n“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine",
        "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\nservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\ninclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to",
        "walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\n\n“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\nCharlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\n\n“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\n\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and",
        "telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\nCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\npass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse",
        "with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\nupstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\nthe door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\nagitation, cried out,--\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “In Conversation with the ladies”",
        "[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]\n\n“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\nhaste, and come down this moment.”\n\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;\nand down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest\nof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the\ngarden gate.",
        "“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter!”\n\n“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady\nCatherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\nother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\ncreature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”",
        "“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\nWhy does she not come in?”\n\n“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\nwhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.”\n\n“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\nmake him a very proper wife.”\n\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation",
        "with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\nway.\n\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked",
        "to dine at Rosings the next day.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     ‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of",
        "doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady\nCatherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\n\n“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\nher Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\nat Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\nit would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\nWho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine",
        "there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\nimmediately after your arrival?”\n\n“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\n“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\n\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what",
        "they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\nElizabeth,--\n\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\nbecomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion",
        "for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\nbeing simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\npreserved.”\n\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\nwho had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her",
        "introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\nto his presentation at St. James’s.\n\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\nacross the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the",
        "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\nincreasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\nElizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\nthought she could witness without trepidation.",
        "From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\nthe servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\nher daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks",
        "which he would have thought necessary.\n\nIn spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her",
        "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\nsilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\nmarked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\nElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she",
        "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\n\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very",
        "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.\n\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\nlooking at in the summer.",
        "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\nand all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\nher Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\nnothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\nand every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\nwas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a",
        "manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\nCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\ngracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\nto them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\nto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all",
        "the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\nlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\nfearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\nand the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every",
        "subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\nher judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\nbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an",
        "occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\nMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\nthe least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\npretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they",
        "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\nobserved,--\n\n“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\nsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss",
        "Bennet?”\n\n“A little.”\n\n“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\n\n“One of them does.”\n\n“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\nyou draw?”\n\n“No, not at all.”\n\n“What, none of you?”\n\n“Not one.”\n\n“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother",
        "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\n\n“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\n\n“Has your governess left you?”\n\n“We never had any governess.”\n\n“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\nhave been quite a slave to your education.”\n\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\nbeen the case.",
        "“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\nhave been neglected.”\n\n“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\nidle certainly might.”\n\n“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage",
        "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite",
        "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\nCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am, all.”\n\n“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\nyounger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\nbe very young?”\n\n“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much",
        "in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\nyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\nmarry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\n\n“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly",
        "for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\n\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\nLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\n\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n\n“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\nconceal your age.”\n\n“I am not one-and-twenty.”",
        "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\nexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or",
        "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\nfor every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\nand noble names.",
        "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\nCollins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As",
        "soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\ncousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\nfor Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\nsatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s\npraise into his own hands.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long\nenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\nmornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her",
        "cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in\nreading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\nElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\nthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\npleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent",
        "reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\nmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened",
        "almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\na few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\nprevailed on to get out.\n\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many",
        "hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.",
        "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\nquarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\nthem into harmony and plenty.\n\n[Illustration:",
        "“he never failed to inform them”\n]\n\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\nof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time",
        "comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.",
        "In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and",
        "she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself.\n\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking",
        "the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The gentlemen accompanied him.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nthe earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\nturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\ntwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought",
        "with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\nand, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\nthe gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\nhusband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\nother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--\n\n“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”",
        "Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her",
        "friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\ncourtesied to him, without saying a word.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of",
        "Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\nway; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--\n\n“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\nhappened to see her there?”\n\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The",
        "subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\naway.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“At Church”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\ntheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\nhouse they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,",
        "almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\nof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\nat the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\nonly seen at church.\n\nThe invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined",
        "the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,",
        "moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\nspirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a",
        "while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\nscruple to call out,--\n\n“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”\n\n“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid\na reply.\n\n“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.",
        "There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\nlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\nhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\n\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.\n\n“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady",
        "Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.”\n\n“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\nShe practises very constantly.”\n\n“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without",
        "constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\nnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\nJenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part\nof the house.”\n\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made\nno answer.",
        "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first",
        "convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--\n\n“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\nintimidate me.”\n\n“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could",
        "not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\nare not your own.”\n\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky",
        "in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\n\n“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.",
        "“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”\n\n“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\nfirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\na ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\ndances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\ndances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more",
        "than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\nyou cannot deny the fact.”\n\n“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.”\n\n“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”\n\n“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”",
        "“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?”\n\n“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\n\n“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,",
        "“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\nconcerns, as I often see done.”\n\n“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\nmasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take",
        "the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\nas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”\n\nDarcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”\n\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.",
        "Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\nto Darcy,--\n\n“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”\n\nElizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his",
        "cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\n\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the",
        "gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was\nready to take them all home.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be",
        "Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her\nhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\nDarcy only, entered the room.\n\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\nbe within.\n\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,",
        "seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,--\n\n“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you",
        "all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”\n\n“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\n\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\npause, added,--\n\n“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\nreturning to Netherfield again?”\n\n“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend",
        "very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\nincreasing.”\n\n“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as",
        "for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\nprinciple.”\n\n“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”\n\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\n\nHe took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable",
        "house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\nCollins first came to Hunsford.”\n\n“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.”\n\n“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”\n\n“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though",
        "I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”\n\n“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\ndistance of her own family and friends.”\n\n“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\n\n“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s\njourney. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”",
        "“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\nof the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins\nwas settled _near_ her family.”\n\n“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”\n\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--",
        "“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_",
        "the present distance.”\n\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\nbeen always at Longbourn.”\n\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--\n\n“Are you pleased with Kent?”\n\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side",
        "calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_\nsurprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\nintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\nwithout saying much to anybody, went away.\n\n[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was",
        "gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\nhave called on us in this familiar way.”\n\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\neven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there",
        "was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he",
        "had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\nfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\nwas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\n\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult",
        "to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\nFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told",
        "her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\nseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it",
        "seemed nothing but absence of mind.\n\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",
        "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: “On looking up”]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,",
        "unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\nthat it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,",
        "but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\nencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\npleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of\nRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to",
        "expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\na little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\npales opposite the Parsonage.\n\nShe was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last",
        "letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\nshe saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\nPutting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--\n\n“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\n\n“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\ndo every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.",
        "Are you going much farther?”\n\n“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\n\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\ntogether.\n\n“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\n\n“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\narranges the business just as he pleases.”\n\n“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems",
        "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\n\n“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\ndependence.”\n\n“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and",
        "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\nwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\n\n“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\nwhere they like.”\n\n“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\ndo.”",
        "“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\nmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\nmoney.”\n\n“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is\nthe usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”",
        "He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\nshe soon afterwards said,--\n\n“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\nfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\nlikes with her.”",
        "“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\n\n“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\nyour charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\na little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\nmay like to have her own way.”\n\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner",
        "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\n\n“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”",
        "“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\n\n“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\n\n“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\nin our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted",
        "to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\nthat Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\n\n“What is it you mean?”\n\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\nwould be an unpleasant thing.”\n\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\n\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be",
        "Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\n\n“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”",
        "“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\nlady.”\n\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\n\n“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\nonly told me what I have now told you.”\n\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\nwas so thoughtful.\n\n“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your",
        "cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\njudge?”\n\n“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\n\n“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\nfriend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\nshe continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed",
        "that there was much affection in the case.”\n\n“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\nlessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\n\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\nmatters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,",
        "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\ntaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and",
        "arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\ninflicted.\n\n“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel",
        "Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\nbusiness in London.\n\n“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\nobjection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\nanything be urged against my father, who, though with some\npeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,",
        "and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\nof her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\nnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\nthe want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\nof sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of",
        "retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins",
        "could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather\ndispleased by her staying at home.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\nmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any",
        "revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s",
        "shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\n\nShe could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his",
        "cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\nthat he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\nmean to be unhappy about him.\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\ndoor-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But",
        "this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\nroom. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her",
        "in an agitated manner, and thus began:--\n\n“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\nyou.”\n\nElizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\nfollowed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the",
        "heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\ndegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\nto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\nsuit.\n\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did",
        "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\nall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of",
        "his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\nfavourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\ncountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\nexasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\nand she said,--\n\n“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be",
        "felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\nof short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\nthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\novercoming it after this explanation.”",
        "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\nhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--",
        "“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\n\n“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have",
        "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?”\n\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\ncontinued,--",
        "“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\nkind.”\n\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening",
        "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n\n“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\n\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\nkinder than towards myself.”\n\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,",
        "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n\n“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\nis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”",
        "“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n\n“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\ninterest in him?”\n\n“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.”\n\n“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\nreduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You",
        "have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\nfor him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\nindependence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\nall this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\ncontempt and ridicule.”\n\n“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I",
        "thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\nwalk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my",
        "being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\n\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to",
        "the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\n\n“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\nmore gentlemanlike manner.”\n\nShe saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\n\n“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.”",
        "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\n\n“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a",
        "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\n\n“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\nwishes for your health and happiness.”\n\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him",
        "the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\nher mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\nand, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\nastonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\nevery review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\nMr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\nso much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections",
        "which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\nmust appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\nincredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\nan affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\nof what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\nwhich he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not",
        "attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\nattachment had for a moment excited.\n\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\nCatherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\nCharlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Hearing herself called”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations",
        "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The",
        "park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\nof the gates into the ground.\n\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her",
        "walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\nwhich edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\nMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\nnow near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\npronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\nthough in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out",
        "a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\ncomposure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\nmeeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\nthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\nout of sight.\n\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written",
        "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\nfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n\n“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\nits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\noffers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,",
        "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\ndemand it of your justice.\n\n“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal",
        "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\nfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other",
        "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\npersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\nto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and",
        "their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\nto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\noffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\nbe obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\nHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\npreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\nit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any",
        "apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\nin love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\nyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\ninformation, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\na general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\nevent, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\nobserved my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive",
        "that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\nin him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\ncheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\nregard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\nthem by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\nhere, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your",
        "sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\nby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\nunreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\nyour sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\nwas not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\nher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my",
        "investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\nfears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\nbelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\nMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\nacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\nin my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\nmy friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes",
        "which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\ninstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\nimmediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\nsituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\ncomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\nuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\noccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend",
        "you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\nand your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\nconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\nany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\nyou and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\ndisposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every",
        "inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\nfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\nNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\nremember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\nnow to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\nwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we",
        "shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\nwent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\nfriend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\nearnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\nhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\nI hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before",
        "believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\nregard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\ndependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\nthat he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\ngiven, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\nhaving done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole",
        "affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\nyour sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\nBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\nhave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\ndid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\ndanger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is",
        "done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\nnothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\nsister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\ngoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\nyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\naccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\nlaying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he",
        "has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\nshall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\nMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\nthe management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\nthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\nto him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and",
        "afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\nalways poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\ngive him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\nyoung man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\nhighest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\nintended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\nsince I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The",
        "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\nguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\nobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\nhad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\ncould not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\nonly can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\ncreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding",
        "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\ndied about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\nlast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\npromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\nallow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\none thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and",
        "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\nthat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\nnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\nbenefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\nmust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\ninsufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be",
        "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\nproposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\nbusiness was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he",
        "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\nnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\ndissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\ndecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\nhe applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\ncircumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\nwere exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,",
        "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\nhim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\ndoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\nhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\nresisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\nthe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in",
        "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\nperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\nknow not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\nnotice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\nmyself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\nto unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\nyour secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left",
        "to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\nmyself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\nestablishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\nthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\nWickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\nacquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\nmost unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far",
        "recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\nstrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\npersuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\nwas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\nherself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\nelopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving",
        "and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\nacted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\nexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\nand Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\nchief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\nthousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging",
        "himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\ncomplete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\ntowards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\nfalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\nwondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning",
        "either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\nnot in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\ntold you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\nwhat could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\nFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\nstill more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been",
        "unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\nyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\nthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\nto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\ncourse of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\n\n“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\nits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to",
        "give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\nhardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s\ninsensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the",
        "real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\nwish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\nwhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\npride and insolence.\n\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\nshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which",
        "bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not",
        "regard it, that she would never look in it again.\n\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly",
        "what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\nthe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\nwas fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\nother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did",
        "not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.",
        "But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\nrender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\nMr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his",
        "entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\npersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Meeting accidentally in Town”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nhimself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\nshe had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and",
        "manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\nfor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\nMr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\ncontinuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him",
        "instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\nremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\nneighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\nthe mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\nmore continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\nbetween Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at",
        "last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\nFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\ninformation of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose\ncharacter she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\nresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\nof the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been",
        "well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.\n\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\nbetween Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions",
        "with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\nthe very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s",
        "character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\nalways prevent his exposing the son.\n\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\nattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had",
        "either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\nand fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their",
        "acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\nsister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his",
        "actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\nas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\n\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.\n\n“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on",
        "my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\nvanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\nhave been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted",
        "prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\nconcerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”\n\nFrom herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to",
        "give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\nof her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what\nCharlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\nof his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\nfervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\ncomplacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\nsensibility.\n\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were",
        "mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.\n\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but",
        "it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\nJane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\nhad ever known before.\n\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every",
        "variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and\nreconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so\nimportant, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at\nlength return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing\ncheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as\nmust make her unfit for conversation.\n\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each",
        "called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\nlonger an object. She could think only of her letter.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“His parting obeisance”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\nhastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,",
        "importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\nhaving them all to dine with her.\n\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\nLadyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how\nwould she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused\nherself.",
        "Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\nThey were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\nColonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\nseemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His",
        "attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\n\nMr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\n\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\nspirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\n\n“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\nmay stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your",
        "company, I am sure.”\n\n“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied\nElizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\nnext Saturday.”\n\n“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\nspare you for another fortnight.”\n\n“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”",
        "[Illustration:\n\n“Dawson”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will\nstay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you\nas far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and\nas Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good\nroom for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be",
        "cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\nlarge.”\n\n“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\noriginal plan.”\n\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the",
        "world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\nDarcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am",
        "glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\n\n“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\n\n“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\nhave somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?\nOh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\nattended to.”\n\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;",
        "and as she did not answer them all herself attention was\nnecessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a\nmind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection\nmust be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave\nway to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a\nsolitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of\nunpleasant recollections.\n\nMr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She",
        "studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\nshe was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or",
        "feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently",
        "united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\nirritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while",
        "Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\never.\n\nAnxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to\nhave been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every",
        "respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\n\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\nseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\n\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of",
        "her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\nthere; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\n\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them",
        "a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\nand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out\nher hand to both.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The elevation of his feelings.”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.",
        "“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\nit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know\nhow little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\nmanner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we\nsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like",
        "yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\nand that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending\nyour time unpleasantly.”\n\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had\nspent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\nCharlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel\nthe obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\nsolemnity replied,--",
        "“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\ntime not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\nfortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior\nsociety, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of\nvarying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that\nyour Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation\nwith regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of",
        "extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on\nwhat a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In\ntruth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this\nhumble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\n\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility",
        "and truth in a few short sentences.\n\n“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,",
        "that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\nother.”\n\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to",
        "have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\nwhom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such\nsociety! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently\nregretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for\ncompassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,\nand all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\n\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels",
        "placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\nMr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\nher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed\nher in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,",
        "when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“They had forgotten to leave any message”\n]\n\n“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects\ndelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\nwhile you have been here.”\n\nElizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and\nthe carriage drove off.",
        "“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems\nbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\nhappened!”\n\n“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.\n\n“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\nHow much I shall have to tell!”\n\nElizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”\n\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and",
        "within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days.\n\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\nspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt\nhad reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\n\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for",
        "Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\nto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\nin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,",
        "and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\nrepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\nfurther.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “How nicely we are crammed in”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\ntogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\nand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was",
        "to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s\npunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\nin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\ndressing a salad and cucumber.\n\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\nout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,",
        "“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”\n\n“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the\nmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing\nher purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\nis very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\nbetter.”\n\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect",
        "unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\nare going in a fortnight.”\n\n“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\n\n“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to",
        "take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\ngo, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\nhave!”\n\n“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\nand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole\ncampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\nregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”",
        "“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to\ntable. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about\na certain person that we all like.”\n\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\nneed not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--\n\n“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse",
        "things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\nmy news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\nThere is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\n\n“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\nimprudent as to fortune.”",
        "“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\n\n“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\n\n“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\nthree straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\nthing?”\n\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\nwas little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\nliberal!",
        "As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\nordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and\nLydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\n\n“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way",
        "home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\nget husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.",
        "Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\nhow I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\n_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\nevening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen",
        "was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a\nlady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.",
        "Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”\n\nWith such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\nassisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.\n\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane",
        "in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\n\n“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\n\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\nwhich occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\ntable, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\nwas doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present",
        "fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\nrather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\n\n“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\nas we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if",
        "Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\ntreated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\nwe never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\nAnd then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\nloud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”",
        "To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,\nto depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\n_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”\n\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\n\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to",
        "Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\nthe scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\nhome half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\nanother reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\nagain, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\n_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped",
        "there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\n\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "CHAPTER XL.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\nDarcy and herself.\n\nMiss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly",
        "natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\nunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.\n\n“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\ndisappointment.”",
        "“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\n\n“Blame you! Oh, no.”\n\n“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\n\n“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\n\n“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\nnext day.”\n\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far",
        "as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\ncollected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\nseek to clear one, without involving the other.",
        "“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\nDarcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\n\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.",
        "“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\nonly consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\nwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\nthing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\nfeel it so.”\n\n“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full",
        "of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\nevery moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\nsaving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as\nlight as a feather.”\n\n“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”\n\n“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the",
        "appearance of it.”\n\n“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\nused to do.”\n\n“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”",
        "“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\nthe matter as you do now.”\n\n“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very\nuncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,\nand vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”\n\n“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions",
        "in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\nundeserved.”\n\n“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\none point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand\nWickham’s character.”\n\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no",
        "occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”\n\n“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to\nmake his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\nso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in",
        "Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to\nit. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to\nanybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found\nout, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\nAt present I will say nothing about it.”\n\n“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to",
        "re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”\n\nThe tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She\nhad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\nfortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\nmight wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\nlurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\nrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister",
        "how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\nwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than\na perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\nthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be\nable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\nhimself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost",
        "all its value!”\n\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\nstate of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\nvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in\nlove before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from\nher age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often\nboast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to",
        "every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those\nregrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their\ntranquillity.\n\n“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of\nthis sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\nof it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I",
        "cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a\nvery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\neverybody, too, who is likely to know.”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “I am determined never to speak of it again”\n]\n\n“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”",
        "“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I\nshall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was\nher, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure\nJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\nhas done.”\n\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she\nmade no answer.\n\n“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the",
        "Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it\nwill last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\nexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,\nshe is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\nhousekeeping, I dare say.”\n\n“No, nothing at all.”\n\n“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed",
        "for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it\nquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”\n\n“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\n\n“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be",
        "ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\nthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\nthe neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,",
        "and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\n\n“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,\nLizzy?”\n\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what",
        "she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.\n\n“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel\nMiller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”\n\n“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.\n\n“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\n\n“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”\n\n“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”",
        "“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”\nadded Kitty.\n\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s\nobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\ninterference in the views of his friend.\n\nBut the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she",
        "received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the\nregiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\ntheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\n\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely",
        "to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew\nabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n\n“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”\nsaid she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much",
        "right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\nher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\nconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her",
        "go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\nbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--\n\n“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little",
        "expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\ncircumstances.”\n\n“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to\nus all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and\nimprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\nwould judge differently in the affair.”\n\n“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away\nsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such",
        "squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\nare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows\nwho have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”\n\n“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\nof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\nimportance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark",
        "Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\nwill be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\nthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the",
        "worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of\nher mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\nis also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever",
        "they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\ndisgrace?”\n\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,\naffectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--\n\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to",
        "Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\nmany degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest",
        "of her life.”\n\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\nShe was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\ndisposition.\n\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her",
        "father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\nunited volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\nShe saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at\npresent unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young",
        "and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\nofficers at once.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Tenderly flirting”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the",
        "same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\nmelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there\nhimself.\n\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving\nhome.\n\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty",
        "well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in",
        "finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\nand her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.\n\nOn the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,\nwith others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth",
        "disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\n\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s\nrecollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,",
        "asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\nWith an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you\nsay that he was at Rosings?”\n\n“Nearly three weeks.”\n\n“And you saw him frequently?”\n\n“Yes, almost every day.”\n\n“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\n\n“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”\n\n“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray",
        "may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in\naddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\nordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more\nserious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”\n\n“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\nwhat he ever was.”\n\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\nrejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a",
        "something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\nand anxious attention, while she added,--\n\n“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\n\nWickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his",
        "embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\naccents,--\n\n“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that",
        "the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\njudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\nhas very much at heart.”\n\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a",
        "slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.\n\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,",
        "from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\nand impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there\nwas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous",
        "happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\nof her sisters were uttered without being heard.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\nThe arrival of the\nGardiners\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHad Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\nof good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a",
        "woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of",
        "the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\n\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her",
        "father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so",
        "unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and",
        "sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what",
        "has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\nforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes",
        "was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n\n“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my",
        "sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\npleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\n\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that",
        "they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\ncamp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\nto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much",
        "too full of lines under the words to be made public.\n\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\ngood-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\nwore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\ncame back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\nBennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\nof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton",
        "without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\nhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\nreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\nsome cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\nshould be quartered in Meryton.\n\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\napproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter",
        "arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the",
        "present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\nDovedale, or the Peak.",
        "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\nand all was soon right again.\n\nWith the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\nowner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,",
        "and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\n\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\nbefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\nMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and",
        "sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\nmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\nenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\nsuitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection",
        "and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\ndisappointments abroad.\n\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\nlay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned that some",
        "acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\nall the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\nLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\nwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\ninclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.",
        "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\nmuch?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\nacquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\nknow.”\n\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\nmust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\nshe really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.",
        "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\nrichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\ngrounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\ncountry.”\n\nElizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such",
        "a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\n\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\nproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her",
        "alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\nto the scheme.\n\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Conjecturing as to the date”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\n\nElizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired",
        "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\nhalf a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\nwoody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was",
        "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,",
        "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was.\n\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They",
        "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace",
        "it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\nto be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\nsuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\nadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\nfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\nfurniture of Rosings.\n\n“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With",
        "these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\nherself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\n\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\n\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really",
        "absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\nreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\nparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\nnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\nthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other",
        "miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\nshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\nhad been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\narmy,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\n\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\nreturn it.",
        "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\nother--about eight years ago.”\n\n“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\nlooking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\nus whether it is like or not.”\n\nMrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\nintimation of her knowing her master.\n\n“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”",
        "Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\n\n“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\n\n“Yes, very handsome.”\n\n“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\nmaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\nbe then. He was very fond of them.”\n\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.",
        "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\nwhen she was only eight years old.\n\n“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\n\n“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\naccomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\nnew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\ncomes here to-morrow with him.”\n\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her",
        "communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\nfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\nmaster and his sister.\n\n“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\n\n“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\n\n“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\n\n“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”",
        "“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\ngood enough for him.”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\n\n“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\nhim,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,",
        "“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\never since he was four years old.”\n\nThis was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\nHer keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\ngrateful to her uncle for saying,--\n\n“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\nhaving such a master.”",
        "“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\nmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\nwas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\nworld.”\n\nElizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\n\n“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n\n“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just",
        "as affable to the poor.”\n\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\nfurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his",
        "many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n\n“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\nlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\ngive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\nsaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\naway like other young men.”",
        "“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\n\n“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\n\n“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\n\n“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\n\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to",
        "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\nlast at Pemberley.\n\n“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\none of the windows.\n\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\nthe room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\nis nothing he would not do for her.”",
        "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\nDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\nalso more intelligible.\n\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have",
        "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\nearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\ngallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his",
        "father’s lifetime.\n\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How",
        "much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\nor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\nthe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\nthe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\nherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\nthan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\nits impropriety of expression.",
        "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\n\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.",
        "They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\nof perfect civility.\n\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,",
        "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she",
        "returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\nminutes in which they continued together were some of the most\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his",
        "inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.\n\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\nleave.\n\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own",
        "feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his",
        "discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.",
        "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\naccount for it.\n\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered",
        "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\nto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he",
        "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\ncomposure.\n\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n\nThey entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,",
        "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed",
        "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\nthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed",
        "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the",
        "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an",
        "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\nhe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\nshe began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not",
        "got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\nrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\nher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\nno more.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\nshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the",
        "acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\nrevolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\nshe, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\nfashion.”\n\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he",
        "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\nconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\nrelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every",
        "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\nhis taste, or his good manners.\n\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was",
        "walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\nwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\ncompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\nextreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\nwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\nthat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\nwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\nme.”",
        "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\nMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\nElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\nher husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on",
        "together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\nvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\nthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that",
        "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\nwill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was",
        "not very differently engaged.\n\n“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\npause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\nduring your stay at Lambton?”\n\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,",
        "must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\nhim think really ill of her.\n\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had",
        "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\nmile behind.\n\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\nthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with",
        "great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\nand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\n\nOn Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\nthe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\nparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\nwalking slowly towards the house.",
        "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n\n“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\n\n“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\naunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n_I_ have seen nothing of it.”",
        "“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\n\n“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\nor rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\ndisagreeable?”\n\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked",
        "him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\n\n“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\nher uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\nat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\nwarn me off his grounds.”\n\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\nnothing.\n\n“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really",
        "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\ngood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal",
        "master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\nevery virtue.”\n\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In",
        "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of",
        "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\n\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above",
        "all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\narrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the",
        "place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\ncurricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\nlivery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\nto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment",
        "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\nElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed",
        "at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\ndreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\nher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.",
        "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.",
        "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.",
        "They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\nElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He",
        "inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\nlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from",
        "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\nit was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\nevident enough.\n\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom",
        "she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.\nBingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be\npleased.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “To make herself agreeable to all”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a\nlike manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on",
        "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No\nlook appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing\noccurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On\nthis point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances",
        "occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted\na recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\nsaying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He\nobserved to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and\nin a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long\ntime since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could\nreply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the",
        "26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\n\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\ngave them meaning.\n\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but",
        "whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\nthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\nhowever temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the\ngood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would",
        "have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,\nbut to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\ntheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the\nchange was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could\nhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\ncompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from",
        "self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings.\n\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner",
        "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of",
        "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\non this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their",
        "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was",
        "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference",
        "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\nthat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had",
        "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known",
        "fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she",
        "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,",
        "there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and",
        "without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,",
        "she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\n\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very",
        "day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been",
        "renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Engaged by the river”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\nwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now\nbe renewed.",
        "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in",
        "London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,",
        "succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.",
        "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she",
        "feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the",
        "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.",
        "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.\n\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him",
        "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive",
        "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss",
        "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\n\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;",
        "but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose",
        "Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\nthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections",
        "her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\n\nElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and",
        "as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above",
        "mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\nMiss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\nperson, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\nbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\ncould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\namiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help",
        "repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n\n“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.”\n\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than",
        "her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything",
        "extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.”\n\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a",
        "determination of making him speak, she continued,--\n\n“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\na beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.”\n\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_",
        "was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\n\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\nboth. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,",
        "except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\nbeginning the subject.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XLVI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from",
        "Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\nthe third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\nit had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\n\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her",
        "uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\nthemselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--\n\n“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a",
        "most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing",
        "to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\nlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\nthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about",
        "twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\nknow what I have written.”",
        "Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\n\n“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest",
        "Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna",
        "Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\nto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\nno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\nhackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the",
        "London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\ninquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\nand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\npass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\nbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any",
        "blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\nmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\ncircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\nprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\ncould form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\nwhich is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed",
        "to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\nhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\nis really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\nbetter, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\nmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared",
        "something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\nover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\nhowever, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\nagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\nare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\nsoon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of",
        "the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\nto try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\nhis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\nbest and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\nagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\nassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”",
        "“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\nimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\nenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.",
        "I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\nI have not an instant to lose.”\n\n“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\n\nElizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back",
        "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\nmistress home instantly.\n\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you",
        "present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\n\n“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\n\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\nsomething indistinctly of his\n\n[Illustration:",
        "“I have not an instant to lose”\n]\n\nconcern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke\nagain. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It\ncannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her\nfriends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\nWickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too\nwell to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that\ncan tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”",
        "Darcy was fixed in astonishment.\n\n“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_\nmight have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained\nsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\nhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\nall too late now.”\n\n“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it\ncertain, absolutely certain?”",
        "“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\nalmost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to\nScotland.”\n\n“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”\n\n“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\nnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have",
        "not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”\n\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n\n“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\n\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power",
        "was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\nwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.",
        "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--",
        "“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything\nto plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\nWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\nthat might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\nyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”",
        "“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”\n\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\nonly one serious parting look, went away.",
        "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.",
        "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,",
        "and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\nhope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least",
        "of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\nthat Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the",
        "intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.\n\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually",
        "fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\nfeel it!\n\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing",
        "could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never",
        "been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be",
        "done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?”\n\n“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n_That_ is all settled.”\n\n“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\nprepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\n\nBut wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the",
        "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\nGardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing",
        "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “The first pleasing earnest of their welcome”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\ndrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much",
        "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\nsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is",
        "not adequate to the risk.”\n\n“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n\n“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\nhim capable of it?”\n\n“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect",
        "I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?”\n\n“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.”\n\n“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.”\n\n“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though",
        "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\n\n“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\nfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending",
        "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your",
        "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\ndo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter.”\n\n“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”",
        "“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\ntears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\na point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle",
        "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\nflirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\neverything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\ngreater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\nare naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”",
        "“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\n\n“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is",
        "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\n\n“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n\n“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\nsuch forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other",
        "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\nher.”\n\n“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\nand Jane seem so well to understand?”",
        "“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\napparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the",
        "neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\nconsequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\nenough from my thoughts.”\n\n“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”",
        "“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\nthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and",
        "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\n\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could",
        "find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\nthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\nto Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\nexpectations.\n\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their",
        "faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n\nElizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\nher mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\n\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\nheard of the fugitives.",
        "“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\neverything will be well.”\n\n“Is my father in town?”\n\n“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\n\n“And have you heard from him often?”\n\n“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.”",
        "“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\n\n“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\nshaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\nHeaven! are quite well.”\n\n“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\nmust have gone through!”\n\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their",
        "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\nthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\n\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,",
        "however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.\n\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous",
        "conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.\n\n“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\nwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\nhad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their",
        "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\nbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\nthe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\nchild! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\nto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what",
        "we shall do.”\n\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n\n“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we",
        "may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.”\n\n“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,",
        "wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\nafter they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my",
        "heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\nLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\nfor she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\n\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\nher hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till",
        "dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\n\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\noppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could",
        "most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\nsubject.\n\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\nbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\nfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\nin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger",
        "which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more\nof fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\nof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--\n\n“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.”",
        "Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\nlesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less\nbrittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\n\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to",
        "make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\n\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\nopportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss",
        "Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\nthe subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I\nhave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”\n\n“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\nespecially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so",
        "grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\n\n“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\n\n“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of",
        "their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\ninclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”\n\n“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\n\n“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in",
        "marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\nbeing in love with each other many weeks.”\n\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\n\n“No, I believe not.”",
        "“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\nknow his real character?”\n\n“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\nbut I hope this may be false.”\n\n“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\nthis could not have happened!”",
        "“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\n\n“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”\n\n“We acted with the best intentions.”\n\n“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\nwife?”\n\n“He brought it with him for us to see.”\n\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\nwere the contents:--\n\n     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */",
        "“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\n     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\n     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\n     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without\n     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the",
        "surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\n     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\n     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my\n     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\n     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my\n     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to",
        "mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed\n     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\n     drink to our good journey.\n\n“Your affectionate friend,\n\n“LYDIA BENNET.”\n\n\n“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had\nfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But\nat least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a",
        "_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”\n\n“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\nsuch confusion!”\n\n“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\n\n“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to",
        "give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\nas I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen\nalmost took from me my faculties.”\n\n“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\nupon yourself alone.”\n\n“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.",
        "Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of\nrepose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on\nTuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady\nLucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\nthey could be of use to us.”",
        "“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too\nlittle of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”\n\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\n\n“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where",
        "they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be\nremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he",
        "determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\nout even so much as this.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     The Post\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next",
        "morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\nThey were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\n\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant",
        "information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to\nthe great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\nsecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to\nher nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a",
        "great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\nthem.\n\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months",
        "before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of",
        "her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\ncome, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\nnews of them.\n\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\nletter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately",
        "found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.\nThat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\ndid not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was",
        "eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and\npromised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this\neffect:--\n\n“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\npossible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\nknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there",
        "were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such\na clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any\nother person.”\n\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for",
        "her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\ninformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\n\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\nand mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,\nhowever, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to\ngive more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.",
        "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was\nthe first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\n\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane",
        "had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\nfollows:--\n\n     /* “My dear Sir, */\n\n     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\n     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\n     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter",
        "from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and\n     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable\n     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\n     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\n     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\n     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\n     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The",
        "death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\n     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n     of behaviour in your\n\n     [Illustration:\n\n“To whom I have related the affair”\n\n     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\n     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,",
        "I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\n     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\n     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in\n     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by\n     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\n     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one\n     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for",
        "who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect\n     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,\n     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\n     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\n     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,\n     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\n     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to",
        "reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\n\n“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.\n\nMr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up\nany connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His\nformer acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the",
        "militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\nwith any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out\nas likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be",
        "necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the\ntown, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner\ndid not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;\nJane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\nunexpected; I had not an idea of it.”\n\nMr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered",
        "spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\nhis brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\n\n“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he",
        "will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?”\n\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\nand her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\n\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her",
        "Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.\nHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\nElizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from\nPemberley.\n\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be",
        "fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\nLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\none sleepless night out of two.\n\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\nphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the",
        "habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\naway; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\nit.\n\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\nand I ought to feel it.”",
        "“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\n\n“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to\nfall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\nIt will pass away soon enough.”\n\n“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\n\n“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\n\n“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.",
        "“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there\nwill probably be of some duration.”\n\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no\nill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,\nconsidering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”\n\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s\ntea.\n\n“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an",
        "elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\nI can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”\n\n“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\n\n“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and",
        "you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house\nagain, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are\nnever to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.”\n\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\n\n“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good",
        "girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\nthem.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\ncoming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their\nmother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,",
        "madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”\n\n“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\n\n“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\nthis half hour, and master has had a letter.”\n\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They",
        "ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\nlibrary;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\nseeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the\nbutler, who said,--\n\n“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the\nlittle copse.”\n\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,\nand ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately",
        "pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\n\nJane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out,--\n\n“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”\n\n“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”\n\n“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”\n\n“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from",
        "his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”\n\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\n\n“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is\nabout.”\n\n     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */\n\n“My dear Brother,\n\n     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\n     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after\n     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what",
        "part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.\n     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them\n     both----”\n\n     [Illustration:\n\n“But perhaps you would like to read it”\n\n     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n     “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”\n\n     Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,\n     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are",
        "willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\n     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\n     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\n     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your\n     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\n     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your\n     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,",
        "considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\n     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\n     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\n     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s\n     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\n     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\n     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are",
        "discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\n     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\n     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will\n     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\n     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\n     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\n     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,",
        "and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my\n     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\n     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\n     anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.\n\n“EDW. GARDINER.”\n\n“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be\npossible that he will marry her?”\n\n“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her",
        "sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\n\n“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.\n\n“No; but it must be done soon.”\n\nMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\nwrote.\n\n“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.”\n\n“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\nyourself.”\n\n“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”",
        "And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\n\n“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be\ncomplied with.”\n\n“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\n\n“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”\n\n“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\nare two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever\nto pay him.”",
        "“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\n\n“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight\na temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\ngone.”\n\n“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,\nit must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”",
        "“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\nless than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\nin the very beginning of our relationship.”\n\n“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\nrepaid?”\n\nMr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued\nsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the\nlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.",
        "“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\nwere by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be\nthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”\n\n“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would\nnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind",
        "uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\nthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\nof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\npounds?”\n\n“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said\nElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has",
        "not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\nrequited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\nfirst sees my aunt!”",
        "“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said\nJane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\nher is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.”\n\n“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor",
        "I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”\n\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\nit known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly\nreplied,--\n\n“Just as you please.”\n\n“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\n\n“Take whatever you like, and get away.”",
        "Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,\nher joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she",
        "had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n\n“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My\ngood, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\neverything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the",
        "clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”\n\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.",
        "Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\n\n“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.”\n\n“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have",
        "ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\n\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and",
        "cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\n\n“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on",
        "Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”\n\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took",
        "refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s\nsituation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she\nhad need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,\nneither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly\nexpected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only\ntwo hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The spiteful old ladies”",
        "[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of",
        "prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\n\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\n\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly",
        "useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\nBennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her",
        "husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\nincome.\n\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In",
        "terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the",
        "hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\nthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\nthat sum.\n\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\nas little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports",
        "of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\ndespatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\nits execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\nindebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\nmessage to her.\n\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate",
        "speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\nfarm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit",
        "in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\nwas considered certain.\n\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those",
        "attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\nproper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\nimportance.\n\n“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\ntoo far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for",
        "Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\n\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\nimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”",
        "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her",
        "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\ntook place.\n\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for",
        "her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.\n\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of",
        "disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\nkind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\n\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The",
        "wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they",
        "should meet.\n\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\nhave been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\nthere must be a triumph.\n\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and",
        "temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\n\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and",
        "precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\nfamily.\n\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\ncould not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\na couple who were only brought together because their passions were\nstronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to",
        "promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\non quitting the militia.\n\n“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his\nmarriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\nconsidering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his",
        "account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\nRegulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\nable and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\nensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\nan advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have",
        "written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\nin and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\npledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\na list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and",
        "all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\nGardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\nleaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.\n\n“E. GARDINER.”\n\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\nremoval from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But",
        "Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\nthe north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.\n\n“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking",
        "to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s\nregiment.”\n\nHis daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\nadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,",
        "urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to\nthe north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon",
        "as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“With an affectionate smile”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTheir sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her",
        "probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\nthem at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\nwas dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\ngave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\nmust endure.\n\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive",
        "them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\nanxious, uneasy.\n\nLydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\nWickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\nalacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.",
        "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\nenough to provoke him.\n\nElizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\nLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at",
        "length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\nsome little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\ngreat while since she had been there.\n\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\nwere always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth",
        "had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\nimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\ncolour.\n\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,",
        "with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\nthe world.\n\n“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\nit seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things",
        "enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.”\n\nHer father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\n\n“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was",
        "afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\nso I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\nnext to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\nwindow frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\nsmiled like anything.”\n\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to",
        "the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to\nher eldest sister,--\n\n“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a\nmarried woman.”\n\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all",
        "their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\neach of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\nand boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n\n“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\nbreakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\ncharming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\nmay have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the",
        "place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\n\n“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\n\n“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\nYou and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\nNewcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\nwill take care to get good partners for them all.”",
        "“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\n\n“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\nwinter is over.”\n\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”\n\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join",
        "his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\n\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\nthink than such as did not.\n\nWickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\nfind it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her",
        "present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion.",
        "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\neverything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\non the first of September than anybody else in the country.\n\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--\n\n“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were",
        "not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\ncurious to hear how it was managed?”\n\n“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\nsaid on the subject.”\n\n“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\no’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others",
        "were to meet us at the church.\n\n“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\nyou know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\nhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\ndressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\nthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\nhe would be married in his blue coat.",
        "“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\n\n“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was",
        "called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\nfrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\nand if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\nout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as",
        "well.”\n\n“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n\n“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\nI quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\n\n“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\n\n“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\nask you no questions.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be so angry.”\n\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\npower, by running away.\n\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\nwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\nsister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.",
        "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\nintended.",
        "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\nspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\nignorance.”\n\n“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the",
        "letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\nout.”\n\nJane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\nit:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“I am sure she did not listen.”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\ncontain a denial.\n\n     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */\n\n“My dear Niece,\n\n     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole",
        "morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\n     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\n     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\n     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\n     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\n     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing",
        "but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\n     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\n     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\n     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\n     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he",
        "had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\n     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\n     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\n     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\n     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or",
        "confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\n     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\n     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\n     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\n     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to",
        "discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\n     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\n     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.",
        "Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\n     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they",
        "would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia",
        "absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\n     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself",
        "obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\n     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\n     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\n     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\n     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\n     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\n     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.",
        "Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\n     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\n     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\n     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\n     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\n     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\n     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there",
        "was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\n     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\n     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\n     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\n     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\n     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did",
        "not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\n     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\n     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\n     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\n     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It",
        "was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\n     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\n     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\n     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\n     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\n     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\n     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have",
        "settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\n     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\n     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\n     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\n     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\n     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that",
        "would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\n     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\n     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\n     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him",
        "alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\n     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\n     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that",
        "your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\n     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I",
        "hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no",
        "fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\n     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\n     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\n     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual",
        "in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He\n     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\n     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\n     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but",
        "a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\n     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\n     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\n     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\n     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\n     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\n     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The",
        "children have been wanting me this half hour.\n\n“Yours, very sincerely,\n\n“M. GARDINER.”\n\n\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\nproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\nsister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of",
        "goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\njust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\nextent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\non himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\nresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\nmust abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\nmeet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always",
        "most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\npronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\nnor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\nwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\nthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\naffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with",
        "Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\nthe connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\nhow much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\nextraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\nshe could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might",
        "assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\nmaterially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\nreturn. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\nhim. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\nhad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\nhim! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that",
        "in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\nof himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\nagain. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\nof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\nboth she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\nsubsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n\nShe was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;",
        "and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by\nWickham.\n\n“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,\nas he joined her.\n\n“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”\n\n“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,\nand now we are better.”\n\n“True. Are the others coming out?”\n\n“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to",
        "Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”\n\nShe replied in the affirmative.\n\n“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\n\n“Yes, she did.”\n\n“And what did she say?”",
        "“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.”\n\n“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--\n\n“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\n\n“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said",
        "Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\ntime of year.”\n\n“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”\n\n“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\n\n“And do you like her?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”",
        "“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\n\n“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\n\n“I do not recollect that we did.”\n\n“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most\ndelightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in\nevery respect.”\n\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\n\n“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,",
        "to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the\nretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of\nhappiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\ncircumstance when you were in Kent?”\n\n“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\n\n“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.”",
        "“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.”\n\n“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”\n\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast",
        "to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--\n\n“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\nquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\nmind.”\n\nShe held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“Mr. Darcy with him.”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]",
        "Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\nhad said enough to keep him quiet.\n\nThe day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.",
        "“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\n\n“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\n\n“Write to me very often, my dear.”\n\n“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\ndo.”\n\nMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.",
        "“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\nthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\nall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\n\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\n\n“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\none’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”",
        "“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\nElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\nsingle.”\n\n“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\n\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an",
        "article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns.\n\n“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\nPhilips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that",
        "I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”\n\n“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose",
        "to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\ngoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\n\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--",
        "“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”",
        "Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it.\n\n“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this",
        "speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\n\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\n\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n\n“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you",
        "will wait on him, of course.”\n\n“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\n\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\nNetherfield.\n\n“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let",
        "him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\nagain.”\n\n“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\non him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\nhim.”",
        "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\n\n“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;",
        "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\nsays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\n\n“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\nalways so much.”\n\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,",
        "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\nand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\nthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\nseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\nHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\npaddock, and ride towards the house.\n\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely",
        "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.\n\n“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\n\n“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.”\n\n“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\nhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”",
        "“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\nMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”\n\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable",
        "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\nmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\nGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\nhim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,",
        "and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered",
        "behaviour in Derbyshire.\n\nThe colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\nwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.\n\n“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\nenough for expectation.”\n\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to",
        "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\nsister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\n\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down",
        "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\n\nBingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period",
        "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher courtesy and address of his friend.\n\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.",
        "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often",
        "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\nwith herself for being so.\n\n“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\n\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\n\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.",
        "“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\n\nHe readily agreed to it.\n\n“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have",
        "seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\n\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth",
        "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.\n\n“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of",
        "his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\ndeserves.”\n\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.",
        "“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\nBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”\n\nElizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be",
        "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\nmoments of such painful confusion.\n\n“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!”\n\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no",
        "compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\nhow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\nlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\nfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\nas handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded",
        "that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.\n\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\nLongbourn in a few days’ time.\n\n“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\nus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you",
        "I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\nengagement.”\n\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\n\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man",
        "on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\nof one who had ten thousand a year.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Jane happened to look round”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\nor, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\nwhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\nher.\n\n“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,",
        "“did he come at all?”\n\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n\n“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\nwas in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\nno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\nno more about him.”\n\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her",
        "better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\n\n“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\nseen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\nacquaintance.”\n\n“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\ntake care.”\n\n“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”",
        "“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\nyou as ever.”\n\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\nhad revived.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as",
        "sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided. He placed himself by her.",
        "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.\n\nHis behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his",
        "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but",
        "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family.\n\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of",
        "bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.",
        "“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\never.”\n\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--",
        "“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?”\n\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\nbeing so silly!\n\n“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not",
        "protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”\n\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\n\n“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\n\n“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”\n\n“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\n\n“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\nthese three weeks.”",
        "She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n\nWhen the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her",
        "mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the",
        "others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\n\n“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\nsay you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\nassure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges",
        "were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\nwhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\ngood a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\ngirls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\n\n[Illustration:",
        "“M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”\n]\n\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\nBingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n\n“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The",
        "party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\nmay often meet again.”\n\nElizabeth smiled.\n\n“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with",
        "greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing, than any other man.”\n\n“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.”\n\n“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\nothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?”\n\n“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive",
        "me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\nconfidante.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\nten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many",
        "expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n\n“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\n\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\nwould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\nthem.\n\n“Can you come to-morrow?”\n\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\naccepted with alacrity.\n\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them",
        "dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\ndressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\n\n“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\nLizzy’s hair.”\n\n“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”",
        "“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\nwhere is your sash, my dear?”\n\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.\n\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at",
        "Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\n\n“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--",
        "“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\n\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\n\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n\n“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in",
        "my dressing-room.”\n\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.\n\nMrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged",
        "officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\ndaughter.\n\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\n\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the",
        "happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\nconcurrence.\n\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption",
        "or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\neverybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\nwrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\nas the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be",
        "wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\n\nBut on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\nshe saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\nmother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\nif engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\nthe faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each",
        "other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\n_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\neither; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\nBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\nwhispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest",
        "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n\n“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\nwhy is not everybody as happy?”\n\nElizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.",
        "“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\n\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.",
        "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\n\n“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\ncircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\nhappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\n\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.",
        "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n\n“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\n\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;",
        "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.\n\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as",
        "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\nhow really happy he was.\n\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their",
        "visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,--\n\n“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\n\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.\n\n“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are",
        "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.”\n\n“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\nunpardonable in _me_.”\n\n“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\nmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so",
        "happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!”\n\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her",
        "favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\n\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after",
        "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.\n\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always",
        "attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\n\n“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\nit possible.”\n\n“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\nit?”\n\n“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to",
        "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.”\n\n“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again",
        "the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\n\n“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\nwould have prevented his coming down again?”\n\n“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\nmodesty.”\n\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.",
        "Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\nof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\nher against him.\n\n“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\nJane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\nabove them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\nanother man for you!”",
        "“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\n\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.",
        "The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the",
        "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the",
        "shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.",
        "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\nother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made.\n\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting",
        "for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\n\n“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\nmother?”\n\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n\n“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”\n\n“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,",
        "who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\n\n“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\nshort silence.\n\n“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\n\n“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\nsummer: the windows are full west.”\n\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,--",
        "“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well?”\n\n“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\n\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\nrefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,",
        "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\n\n“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.”\n\n“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\n\nElizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,",
        "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\ndecent-looking rooms, walked on.\n\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for",
        "conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\ndisagreeable.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“After a short survey”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\nher face.\n\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--\n\n“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\ncome.”",
        "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n\n“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\nfor the honour of seeing you here.”\n\n“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to\nknow that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such",
        "moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on",
        "setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.”\n\n“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”\n\n“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\n\n“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\ncoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.”",
        "“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?”\n\n“I never heard that it was.”\n\n“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”\n\n“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\n\n“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has",
        "he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\n\n“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\n\n“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\nmay have drawn him in.”\n\n“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\n\n“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such",
        "language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\n\n“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.”\n\n“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”\n\n“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will",
        "make an offer to me.”\n\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--\n\n“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the\nunion; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\naccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of",
        "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\n\n“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be",
        "kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\nMiss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\n\n“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss\nBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or",
        "friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\nby any of us.”\n\n“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\nto repine.”",
        "“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I\nbe dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\n\n“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;",
        "but it will have no effect on _me_.”\n\n“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,\nhonourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide",
        "them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\nconnections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\nnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\n\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are\nequal.”\n\n“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who",
        "are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\ncondition.”\n\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\n\n“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\n\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\nmoment’s deliberation,--\n\n“I am not.”\n\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.",
        "“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\n\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\n\n“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\nassurance I require.”\n\n“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry",
        "your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\nhis cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.",
        "How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the\nsubject.”\n\n“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\nobjections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a",
        "patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\n_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\nof his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of\nwhat are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\n\n“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\n“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\nthe house.”",
        "And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\nback. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.\n\n“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\n\n“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”\n\n“You are then resolved to have him?”\n\n“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,",
        "which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”\n\n“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”\n\n“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either",
        "would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\nthe scorn.”\n\n“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\nshall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your",
        "ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\nreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”\n\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--\n\n“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\nmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”\n\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her",
        "Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n\n“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”\n\n“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.",
        "She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\n\nElizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “But now it comes out”\n]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw",
        "Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\nhours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,",
        "and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\nonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had",
        "looked forward to as possible at some future time.\n\nIn revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\napplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared",
        "not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak",
        "and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.",
        "“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\nfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\nat all.”\n\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\nbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same",
        "kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\n\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\n\n“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”\n\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\nher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner",
        "connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\nconsequent explanations.\n\nShe followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\nthen said,--\n\n“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\ncontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink",
        "of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\n\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself, when her father continued,--\n\n“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters",
        "as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\n\n“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”\n\n“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says",
        "on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\nher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\nmay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages",
        "in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\n‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\nheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\nextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\nmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\nprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,\nyou will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,",
        "Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for\ncautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\neye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any",
        "woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\nhis life! It is admirable!”\n\nElizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\nlittle agreeable to her.\n\n“Are you not diverted?”\n\n“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”\n\n“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she",
        "felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\nsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\nher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\nduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.\nCollins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad",
        "business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as",
        "a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\nChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\nCharlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\nLizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\n_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\nin our turn?”",
        "“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\nstrange!”\n\n“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_\npointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and",
        "hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\n\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by",
        "what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of\nhis seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The efforts of his aunt”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy",
        "with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to",
        "outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\ndesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.\n\nThey walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the",
        "moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was\nhigh, she immediately said,--\n\n“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving\nrelief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\nsister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest",
        "of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”\n\n“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\nwas so little to be trusted.”\n\n“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could",
        "not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\nsake of discovering them.”\n\n“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your",
        "_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\nonly of _you_.”\n\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\nher companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\naffections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence\nme on this subject for ever.”\n\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of",
        "his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\nso material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\nhappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth",
        "been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\nthough she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\nevery moment more valuable.\n\nThey walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She",
        "soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\nto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from",
        "her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\nLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n\n“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”\n\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of",
        "my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\nyour relations.”\n\n“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\nto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\n\n“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that",
        "evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\nexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\nimproved in civility.”\n\n“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a",
        "more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\nconfess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\n\n“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.”\n\n“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never",
        "forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway that would induce you to accept me.”\n\n“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\n\nDarcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\ncontents?”\n\nShe explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all",
        "her former prejudices had been removed.\n\n“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\nespecially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\nof reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\nmake you hate me.”\n\n“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my",
        "opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.”\n\n“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.”\n\n“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\nof the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely",
        "different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\nattending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\nphilosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\npleasure.”\n\n“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\nignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will",
        "intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\nI was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,",
        "almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a",
        "doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\n\n“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\n\n“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\nwishing, expecting my addresses.”\n\n“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”",
        "“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\ntake a proper direction.”\n\n“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\n\n“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\n\n“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”",
        "“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\nan hour after I had seen you.”\n\nHe then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her",
        "disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\ncomprehend.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\neach to be dwelt on farther.",
        "After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\nit was time to be at home.\n\n“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which\nintroduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\nit.\n\n“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.",
        "“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\n\n“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\nthe case.\n\n“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\nhim of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had",
        "the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\n\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\nfriend.\n\n“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”",
        "“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\n\n“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\nhim.”\n\n“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\nhis reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\nthing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not",
        "allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\nnow.”\n\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked",
        "herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and\nit was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of\nBingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\nparted.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n     “Unable to utter a syllable”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question",
        "which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\nreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\n\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.",
        "Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.",
        "At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\nfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n\n“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\nyou shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”\n\n“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\nand I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\nam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\nare engaged.”",
        "Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\nyou dislike him.”\n\n“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.”\n\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously, assured her of its truth.\n\n“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried",
        "Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\ncertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\nhappy with him?”\n\n“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\nare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\nShall you like to have such a brother?”\n\n“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you",
        "really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\nto do?”\n\n“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\ntell you all.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\nafraid you will be angry.”\n\n“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\nLet me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me",
        "how long you have loved him?”\n\n“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\nbut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\nat Pemberley.”\n\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfurther to wish.\n\n“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I",
        "always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\nof it to another, not to you.”\n\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to",
        "mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\nconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\nand half the night spent in conversation.\n\n“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\nmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always",
        "coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\nway.”\n\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\nepithet.\n\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and",
        "shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\n\n“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\nnever seen the view.”\n\n“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”",
        "Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\nconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\nsaying,--\n\n“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\nall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”",
        "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\nasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\napplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to",
        "her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.\n\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\nextreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be",
        "filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\nwants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\n\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.",
        "“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\n\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.",
        "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\nBut will they make you happy?”\n\n“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\nindifference?”\n\n“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”\n\n“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.",
        "Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.”\n\n“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor",
        "respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\nabout.”\n\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the",
        "object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\nshe did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\nmatch.\n\n“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with",
        "you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\n\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n\n“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\nand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have",
        "paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\n\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\nMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”",
        "Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\nhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\nthe others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\nwould come in time.\n\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,",
        "and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\nfor, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\ncomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\nwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.",
        "“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\nhave thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\nyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\ndear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything",
        "that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\nLord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”\n\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.\n\n“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a",
        "special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\nBut, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\nof, that I may have it to-morrow.”\n\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow",
        "passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\nevery hour in his esteem.\n\n“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,",
        "is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\nas Jane’s.”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“The obsequious civility.”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nElizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could\nyou begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\nyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\nplace?”",
        "“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\nlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\nknew that I _had_ begun.”\n\n“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\nsincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\n\n“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”",
        "“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\namiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and",
        "in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\nand really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\nreasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\nof _that_ when they fall in love.”\n\n“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was\nill at Netherfield?”\n\n“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it",
        "by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\nbe; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling\nto come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you\nfirst called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”",
        "“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”\n\n“But I was embarrassed.”\n\n“And so was I.”\n\n“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\n\n“A man who had felt less might.”\n\n“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\nyou _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of",
        "thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too\nmuch_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\nsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the\nsubject? This will never do.”\n\n“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\nCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to",
        "your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to\nwait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,\nand I was determined at once to know everything.”\n\n“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\nor had you intended any more serious consequences?”",
        "“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\nmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\nmyself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and\nif she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”\n\n“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\nbefall her?”\n\n“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to",
        "be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done\ndirectly.”\n\n“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”\n\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\nhad been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s\nlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would",
        "be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt\nhad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\nfollows:--\n\n“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\nfor your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the\ntruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,",
        "indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly\nerr. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more\nthan you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to\nthe Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the\nponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the\nhappiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so",
        "before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\nonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\ncan be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\nYours,” etc.\n\nMr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still\ndifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return\nfor his last.\n\n     /* “Dear Sir, */\n\n     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will",
        "soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\n     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\n     more to give.\n\n“Yours sincerely,” etc.\n\nMiss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching\nmarriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to\nJane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former\nprofessions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and",
        "though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.\n\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was\nas sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.\n\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the",
        "Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she",
        "saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\n\nMrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his",
        "forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s\ngood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be\nvulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at\nall likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to\nkeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might",
        "converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its\npleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward\nwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society so\nlittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their\nfamily party at Pemberley.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got",
        "rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she\nafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be\nguessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of\nher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,\nit was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic",
        "felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous\nand invariably silly.\n\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\n\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to",
        "_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\nsisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\nto Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\n\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a",
        "temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s\nsociety she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\n\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily",
        "drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\nmuch reluctance.\n\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from",
        "the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\neverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\nprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The",
        "letter was to this effect:--\n\n     /* “My dear Lizzy, */\n\n     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\n     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\n     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\n     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\n     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\n     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four",
        "hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\n     if you had rather not.\n\n“Yours,” etc.\n\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an",
        "income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\ndischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a",
        "cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\nfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\nreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\nreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him\nfurther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\nher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the",
        "Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even\nBingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\n\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\ndropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\nto Elizabeth.",
        "Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\nother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\nastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open",
        "pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\nher way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\n\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him",
        "language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had",
        "received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\n\nWith the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms.

        "CHAPTER XV.\n CHAPTER XVI.\n CHAPTER XVII.\n CHAPTER XVIII.\n CHAPTER XIX.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME I\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and\nhappy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\nexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\nlittle to distress or vex her.\n\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage,",
        "been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had\ndied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\nof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\nas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\n\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even",
        "before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\nthe mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\nrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\nhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\nand Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s\njudgment, but directed chiefly by her own.\n\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having",
        "rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so\nunperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\nher.\n\nSorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any\ndisagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor’s\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this",
        "beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\nand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\ncheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after\ndinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\nhad lost.\n\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was\na man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and",
        "pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\nwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. The want\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\npast kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed",
        "her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\nthe equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\nIsabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and",
        "peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\nhers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\n\nHow was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\nMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and",
        "domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\nsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\nHe could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\n\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\nor body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though",
        "everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\n\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,",
        "and give her pleasant society again.\n\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for",
        "even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\nsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\nand made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\nwas a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\nused to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\nMatrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\nby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could",
        "ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\nmatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\ntoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\nto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\nwas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\nherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\nhad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and",
        "chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\nwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\nsaid at dinner,\n\n“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!”\n\n“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\ngood-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a\ngood wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for",
        "ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\nown?”\n\n“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\nThis is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my\ndear.”\n\n“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\nvisit very soon.”\n\n“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\nnot walk half so far.”",
        "“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\nto be sure.”\n\n“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\nlittle way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\nvisit?”\n\n“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going",
        "to Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\nmentioned her—James is so obliged to you!”\n\n“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken",
        "girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will",
        "be able to tell her how we all are.”\n\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\nthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.\n\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly",
        "connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\nsome days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\nWoodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which",
        "always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\nhave had a shocking walk.”\n\n“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\nmust draw back from your great fire.”\n\n“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\ncatch cold.”",
        "“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”\n\n“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”\n\n“By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\nall behave? Who cried most?”",
        "“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.”\n\n“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.”\n\n“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\ncreature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I",
        "know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”\n\n“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with\na sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”\n\n“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a\njoke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”",
        "Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\nwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\nevery body.\n\n“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no",
        "reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\na gainer.”\n\n“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about the\nwedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\nnot a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\nwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting",
        "every day.”\n\n“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”\n\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It is\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\nKnightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s",
        "advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.”\n\n“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a\nvery considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match,",
        "you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\nmay comfort me for any thing.”\n\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah! my\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\nmatches.”\n\n“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for",
        "other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\nsuccess, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.",
        "Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\n\n“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from",
        "Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\nmatch-making.”\n\n“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley.\n“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But",
        "if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\nmeans only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I\nthink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\nto marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then\nafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\nyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\nsaid.”\n\n“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I",
        "pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\nword ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\nbut I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might",
        "not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\nenough to comprehend that.”\n\n“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\ngood to them, by interference.”\n\n“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not",
        "make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family\ncircle grievously.”\n\n“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\nElton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\nHighbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\nhim single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands",
        "to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\nkind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\nthe only way I have of doing him a service.”\n\n“Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good\nyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew\nhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.\nThat will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so\nkind as to meet him.”",
        "“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley,\nlaughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into",
        "gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by\nentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\n\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great",
        "Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\nsurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\nwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would\noffend.\n\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\nfortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off",
        "with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce\nmuch happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had\na husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing\ndue to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but\nnot enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s",
        "unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\n\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he",
        "was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\nmother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\ncreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\nof the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some",
        "reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\nwere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\ncare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\nto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\n\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which",
        "brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\noccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\nyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\nrealised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little\nestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to\nmarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according",
        "to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.\n\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\nhad not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained",
        "his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.",
        "He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\nuncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,\ntherefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance. His father\nhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and\ngoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston’s nature to",
        "imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,\nand, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in\nLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\nlooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\nprospects a kind of common concern.\n\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively",
        "curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\n\nNow, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not\na dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea\nwith Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the",
        "visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and\nthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his\nnew mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in\nHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had\nreceived. “I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank\nChurchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very\nhandsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw",
        "the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his\nlife.”\n\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate",
        "she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\n\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\npain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would",
        "have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance\nof Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female\nwalking, and in Mr. Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which would\nmake the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the\nevenings in the week together.",
        "Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more\nthan satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\nat his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her",
        "own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,\nand saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”\n\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could",
        "bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\nunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\nthem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\nearnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it. He had been at the\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\nPerry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were",
        "one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to,\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\nmany—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.",
        "There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own",
        "little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance\nbut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,\nHighbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in\nthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many\nsuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of the",
        "chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he\npreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to\ncompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could\nnot make up a card-table for him.\n\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and\nby Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the",
        "elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\n\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it",
        "would have been a grievance.\n\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.",
        "Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and",
        "a woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\nevery body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to\nevery body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful",
        "spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\ngossip.\n\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or an\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\nmorality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies",
        "for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a\nreal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\ngirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\na little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\nGoddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highbury\nwas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and",
        "garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\na great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\nher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\nMr. Woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her",
        "neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\n\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\ncollect; and happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power;\nthough, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the\nabsence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look\ncomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things",
        "so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that\nevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had\nfearfully anticipated.\n\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\npresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\nrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\nwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew",
        "very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her\nbeauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\nlonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\n\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\nher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had\nlately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.",
        "She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\nladies who had been at school there with her.\n\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\ngreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much",
        "pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\ncontinue the acquaintance.\n\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith’s\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing,\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\nthe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had",
        "been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\nHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\nwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\nvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a",
        "large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very\ncreditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\nthem—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and\nelegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve\nher; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It",
        "would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly\nbecoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\n\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to",
        "the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common\nimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of\ndoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\nmind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of\nthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped\noysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the\nearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.",
        "Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare.\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality\nwould have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their\nhealth made him grieve that they would eat.\n\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he",
        "could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might\nconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer\nthings, to say:\n\n“Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of",
        "our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\n_little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it\ncould disagree with you.”\n\nEmma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much",
        "more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which\nMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken",
        "hands with her at last!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nHarriet Smith’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance\nincreased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking\ncompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston’s loss had been important. Her father never",
        "went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\nhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\nWeston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\nventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\nSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\nwould be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\nas she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her",
        "kind designs.\n\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\nvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\nof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith’s being exactly the",
        "young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required.\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\nthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.\nWeston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.",
        "Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in\nthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\nhad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just\nwhat Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.",
        "Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the\nconversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with\nthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her",
        "talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and\nenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\nexultation of Mrs. Martin’s having “_two_ parlours, two very good\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard’s\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch",
        "cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin’s saying as she was so fond of it, it\nshould be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\ndrink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\npeople.”\n\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and",
        "daughter, a son and son’s wife, who all lived together; but when it\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were\nnot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.",
        "With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\ngood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\norder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was",
        "of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\nshepherd’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\nShe was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\nbelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\nfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\nwool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\nof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had",
        "told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\nimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\nwhenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she\n_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.\n\n“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you are about.”\n\n“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever",
        "seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\nher.”\n\n“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\nhis own business? He does not read?”\n\n“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good\ndeal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the",
        "window seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\ncan.”\n\nThe next question was—\n\n“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”",
        "“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\nKingston. He has passed you very often.”\n\n“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,",
        "is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.”\n\n“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed",
        "him; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”\n\n“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\nhis age to be?”\n\n“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n23rd just a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.”\n\n“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as",
        "they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\nmight be very desirable.”\n\n“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”\n\n“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune",
        "entirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\nany thing yet.”\n\n“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no",
        "indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\nof taking a boy another year.”\n\n“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\nmarry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly",
        "careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\ngentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\nby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people\nwho would take pleasure in degrading you.”\n\n“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\nbody can do.”\n\n“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I",
        "would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to\nhave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if\nyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you\nmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted\nwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter,\nwithout education.”",
        "“To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\nbut what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However,\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not",
        "visit her, if I can help it.”\n\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,\nbut she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no\nserious difficulty, on Harriet’s side, to oppose any friendly\narrangement of her own.\n\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at",
        "her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\nthought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet’s",
        "inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\nnoticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\n\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\ncompose.\n\n“Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a",
        "chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot\nit, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!\nWell, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think\nof him? Do you think him so very plain?”",
        "“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\ndegree or two nearer gentility.”\n\n“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel\nas real gentlemen.”\n\n“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been",
        "repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\ninferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?",
        "Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.”\n\n“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air\nand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.\nBut Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!”\n\n“Mr. Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to",
        "compare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being\nsilent. You must see the difference.”\n\n“Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old",
        "man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”\n\n“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\nWeston’s time of life?”\n\n“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.",
        "“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\nnothing but profit and loss.”\n\n“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”\n\n“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\nelse—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to",
        "do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\nrich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\n_us_.”\n\n“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all Harriet’s answer, and\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\nnext beginning was,\n\n“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton’s manners are superior to Mr.",
        "Knightley’s or Mr. Weston’s. They have more gentleness. They might be\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley’s downright, decided, commanding\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to",
        "set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I\nthink a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as\na model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He\nseems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to",
        "please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”\n\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from\nMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,\nand said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\n\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\nfarmer out of Harriet’s head. She thought it would be an excellent\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her",
        "to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet’s coming to\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of\nits expediency. Mr. Elton’s situation was most suitable, quite the\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of",
        "any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\n\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful",
        "girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet’s there could be little\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned\nvery handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense",
        "with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin’s riding\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered\nby Mr. Elton’s admiration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr.\nKnightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but\nI think it a bad thing.”\n\n“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”\n\n“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”",
        "“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with\na new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have\nbeen seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very\ndifferently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any good! This\nwill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\nKnightley.”\n\n“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”",
        "“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he\nthinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only\nyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there\nshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.\nKnightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You\nare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a\ncompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a",
        "woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\nit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is\nnot the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. But on\nthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an\ninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She\nmeans it, I know.”\n\n“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years",
        "old. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\nof books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists\nthey were—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimes\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up\nwhen only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of",
        "steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring\nindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade her\nto read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not.”\n\n“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought so\n_then_;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s omitting\nto do any thing I wished.”",
        "“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”—said\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “But I,”\nhe soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able\nto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was\nalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since",
        "she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In\nher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits\nher mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”\n\n“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted another\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”",
        "“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself\nto be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on\nthe very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\ndoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a",
        "wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.”\n\n“Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.”\n\n“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\nthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\nWe will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness\nof comfort, or his son may plague him.”\n\n“I hope not _that_.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not",
        "foretell vexation from that quarter.”\n\n“Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma’s\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But\nHarriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a",
        "flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_\ncannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of\nconceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just\nrefined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and",
        "circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s\ndoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\nadapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\nlife.—They only give a little polish.”\n\n“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am more\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\nHow well she looked last night!”\n\n“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very",
        "well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”\n\n“Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\nbeauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?”\n\n“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\nold friend.”\n\n“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features,\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,",
        "and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”\n\n“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I think her\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,",
        "that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”\n\n“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is an\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder",
        "sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\ntimes.”\n\n“Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and\nIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind\naffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not",
        "quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their\nopinions with me.”\n\n“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a",
        "matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\nsource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\ngive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this\nlittle remains of office.”",
        "“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\nfound; for it shall be attended to.”\n\n“Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\nher sister.”\n\n“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\nill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;",
        "perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\nfeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!”\n\n“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”\n\n“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\ncared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\nwith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some",
        "doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\nto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.”\n\n“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her\nresolution at present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be; and while\nshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any\nattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.\nWoodhouse’s account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,",
        "though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.”\n\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\nand Mr. Weston’s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\nat Randalls respecting Emma’s destiny, but it was not desirable to have\nthem suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\nafterwards made to “What does Weston think of the weather; shall we\nhave rain?” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise\nabout Hartfield.",
        "CHAPTER VI\n\n\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet’s fancy a proper\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\nElton’s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of\ncreating as much liking on Harriet’s side, as there could be any",
        "occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton’s being in the\nfairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no\nscruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so\nwarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little\ntime would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of\nHarriet’s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of\nthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.",
        "“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he; “you have\nmade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came\nto you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.”\n\n“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\nnatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\ndone very little.”",
        "“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.\nElton—\n\n“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”\n\n“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”\n\n“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\nmore truly amiable.”\n\n“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing",
        "animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\nto have Harriet’s picture.\n\n“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she: “did you\never sit for your picture?”\n\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\nwith a very interesting naïveté,\n\n“Oh! dear, no, never.”\n\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,",
        "“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\npassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\nwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\nanother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\nif Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\npicture!”",
        "“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. Elton; “it would indeed be a delight!\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in\nfavour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you\nsuppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\nlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”\n\nYes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking",
        "likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don’t pretend to be in\nraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet’s face. “Well, if\nyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\nwhat I can do. Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a\nlikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\neye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.”\n\n“Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I have",
        "not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.”\n\n“But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of\nanswering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be\ndrawn?’”\n\n“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”",
        "Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\ndirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\nattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\nthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\nbeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,",
        "pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\nalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\nshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;—and drew in almost every\nstyle; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she\napproached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to\ncommand, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as",
        "to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\nunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\naccomplishment often higher than it deserved.\n\nThere was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps the\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\nthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\ncompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A",
        "likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse’s performances must be\ncapital.\n\n“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only my own\nfamily to study from. There is my father—another of my father—but the\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.",
        "There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her\nfour children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\nattempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry and\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them",
        "drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\ncoarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s",
        "very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\nis very good. Then here is my last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a\ngentleman in small size, whole-length—“my last and my best—my brother,\nMr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\ncould not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\nreally made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite",
        "agreed in thinking it _very_ like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but\nthat was a fault on the right side”—after all this, came poor dear\nIsabella’s cold approbation of—“Yes, it was a little like—but to be\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\npersuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every",
        "morning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.”\n\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and\nwas repeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a",
        "consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\n\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley’s, and was\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\nstation over the mantelpiece.\n\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not",
        "keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\nto employ him in reading.",
        "“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith’s.”\n\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\nless would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\nat the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the",
        "progress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an\nencourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.\n\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\npleased with the first day’s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant",
        "to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\ndestined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton’s very promising\nattachment was likely to add.",
        "Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\n\n“By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\nparty.”\n\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\npicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\nbut Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every",
        "criticism.\n\n“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\nwanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least suspecting that\nshe was addressing a lover.—“The expression of the eye is most correct,\nbut Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\nher face that she has them not.”\n\n“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears to\nme a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a",
        "likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”\n\n“You have made her too tall, Emma,” said Mr. Knightley.\n\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\nadded,\n\n“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,\nshe is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short\ngives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\nProportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of",
        "such a height as Miss Smith’s. Exactly so indeed!”\n\n“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done! Just as\nyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\nwell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she\nseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\nshoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold.”\n\n“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\nLook at the tree.”",
        "“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”\n\n“You, sir, may say any thing,” cried Mr. Elton, “but I must confess\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\nof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any\nother situation would have been much less in character. The naïveté of\nMiss Smith’s manners—and altogether—Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot\nkeep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”",
        "The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\nfew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose\ntaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all\ncommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.\nWoodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in\nthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.",
        "Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.\n“Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should\nhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was\nimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\nsuch an errand.”\n\n“He was too good!—she could not endure the thought!—she would not give\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,”—brought on the desired",
        "repetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled\nthe business.\n\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\nnot being incommoded enough.\n\n“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received\nit.\n\n“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma. “I should",
        "say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\nexactly; it will be an ‘Exactly so,’ as he says himself; but he does\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet’s account.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe very day of Mr. Elton’s going to London produced a fresh occasion",
        "for Emma’s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\nreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked\nof, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\nMrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and",
        "finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs\nwhich she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this\nletter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal\nof marriage. “Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did\nnot know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good",
        "letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her\nvery much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she\ncould to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—” Emma was half-ashamed\nof her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\n\n“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any\nthing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”\n\n“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do. II’d rather you\nwould.”",
        "Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The\nstyle of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not\nmerely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have\ndisgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and\nunaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of\nthe writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,\nliberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,",
        "while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a “Well,\nwell,” and was at last forced to add, “Is it a good letter? or is it\ntoo short?”\n\n“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather slowly—“so good\na letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I\nsaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;",
        "no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\ntalent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand,\nhis thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,\nI understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a\ncertain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning\nit,) than I had expected.”",
        "“Well,” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well—and—and what shall I do?”\n\n“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\nletter?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and\nspeedily.”\n\n“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”\n\n“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your",
        "not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\nconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\ndisappointment.”\n\n“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.",
        "“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\ndoubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you\nfeel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you\nwere consulting me only as to the wording of it.”\n\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n\n“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”",
        "“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\ndo.”\n\n“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”\n\n“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that",
        "letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n\n“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\nrefuse him. If she can hesitate as to ‘Yes,’ she ought to say ‘No’\ndirectly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\nfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\nolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I\nwant to influence you.”",
        "“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would\njust advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you\nsay, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be\nhesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say ‘No,’\nperhaps.—Do you think I had better say ‘No?’”\n\n“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I advise you\neither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you",
        "prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this\nmoment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\nmoment whom are you thinking of?”\n\nThe symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away",
        "confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\nstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without\nregard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong\nhopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said—\n\n“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as\nwell as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really\nalmost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”",
        "“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have\ngrieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not",
        "influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could\nnot have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am\nsecure of you for ever.”\n\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\nforcibly.\n\n“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “No, to be\nsure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\nbeen too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not",
        "give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any\nthing in the world.”\n\n“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\nI must have given you up.”\n\n“Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!”\n\n“Dear affectionate creature!—_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—_You_",
        "confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.”\n\n“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet, her\nconscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\nfor—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he",
        "may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\n_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\nMartin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\nhis being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as\nto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.”",
        "“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”\n\n“Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.”\n\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\nher husband could write a good letter.”",
        "“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?”\n\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every",
        "sentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\naccepted after all.",
        "This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\nby speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\nidea of Mr. Elton.\n\n“I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather a\nsorrowful tone.\n\n“Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You",
        "are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\nAbbey-Mill.”\n\n“And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\nbut at Hartfield.”\n\nSome time afterwards it was, “I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\nlinen-draper.”\n\n“One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher",
        "of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\nthe only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\nthemselves.”\n\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that",
        "people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\n\n“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what they are\nall doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will be\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.”\n\n“Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\nemployed,” cried Emma. “At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing",
        "your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.”\n\n“My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street.”\n\n“Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this",
        "evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\ntheir imaginations all are!”\n\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been",
        "spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a\nbed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\nrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\njust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\ntwo to Mrs. Goddard’s, but it was then to be settled that she should\nreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\n\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.",
        "Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\nmind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and\nwas induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of\nhis own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.\nKnightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his\nshort, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies\nand civil hesitations of the other.",
        "“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma’s advice and\ngo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\nbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\nMr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.”\n\n“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”\n\n“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to",
        "entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\nthree turns—my winter walk.”\n\n“You cannot do better, sir.”\n\n“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am\na very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides,\nyou have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.”\n\n“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\nthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open\nthe garden door for you.”",
        "Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\n\n“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a pretty\nlittle creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.”",
        "“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\nwanting.”\n\n“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\nthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s\ngiggle; she really does you credit.”\n\n“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had\nbeen of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where\nthey may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.”\n\n“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”",
        "“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\nintended.”\n\n“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”\n\n“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”\n\n“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”\n\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\nnothing. He presently added, with a smile,\n\n“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I\nhave good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of",
        "something to her advantage.”\n\n“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”\n\n“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.\n\n“Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her?\nWho makes you their confidant?”\n\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton’s having dropt a hint.\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\nMr. Elton looked up to him.\n\n“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon",
        "have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\nquarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this\nsummer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and\nmeans to marry her.”\n\n“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to\nmarry him?”\n\n“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows",
        "I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear",
        "better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent",
        "him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not\nallow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be\nat Mrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without",
        "thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.”\n\n“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\nthrough a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin\ndid not speak yesterday?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know it; but\nit may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”\n\n“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for what you\nhave told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was\nrefused.”",
        "This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\nstood up, in tall indignation, and said,\n\n“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\nfoolish girl about?”\n\n“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”",
        "“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.”\n\n“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”\n\n“You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”\n\n“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,",
        "but I cannot admit him to be Harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\ngot over.”\n\n“Not Harriet’s equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is not\nher equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are",
        "Harriet Smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she",
        "can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to",
        "trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\nwould not regret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her",
        "being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, ‘Even Emma, with\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.’”\n\n“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you",
        "should think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\nYou are not just to Harriet’s claims. They would be estimated very\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\nsociety.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a\ndegradation.”\n\n“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a",
        "respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”\n\n“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\nwhom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\nis a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or",
        "comfort.—That she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me; that\nshe associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\ndeny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”\n\n“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever may have\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.",
        "Goddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs.\nGoddard’s line, to have Mrs. Goddard’s acquaintance. Her friends\nevidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\nShe desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a\nfriend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\nbeyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.\nShe had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given",
        "it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would\nnever have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not\nbeing disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling\nto address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to\nconceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it\nhe had encouragement.”\n\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this",
        "assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\nagain.\n\n“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\nunjust to Harriet. Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\nher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\nhowever, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and",
        "good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\nthey are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\nis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\npeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\nphilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\nfaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of",
        "being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\namong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\nnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\nsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\ngreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\nmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\ntemper, the highest claims a woman could possess.”",
        "“Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\nit as you do.”\n\n“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know _that_ is the feeling of you\nall. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man\ndelights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just",
        "entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No—pray let\nher have time to look about her.”\n\n“I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said Mr. Knightley\npresently, “though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will\npuff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a",
        "claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good\nenough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of\nmischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations\ntoo high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so\nfast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may\nchuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very\nfond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most",
        "prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they\nmight be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be\nrevealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable,\nand happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry\ngreatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of\nconsequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs.\nGoddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is",
        "a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and\nis glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.”\n\n“We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\nangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is\nimpossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must\nprevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having",
        "refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will\nnot pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I\nassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His\nappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she\never were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that\nbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was\nthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and",
        "altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great\nassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him\ndisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen\nare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\nwith Harriet.”\n\n“Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried Mr.\nKnightley.—“Robert Martin’s manners have sense, sincerity, and\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility",
        "than Harriet Smith could understand.”\n\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him",
        "sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\non Emma’s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\n\n“Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope it\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it",
        "is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\nwill be all labour in vain.”\n\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\n\n“Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is",
        "as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet’s.\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.”",
        "“I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again. “If I had\nset my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would have been very\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.”\n\n“Good morning to you,”—said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was",
        "mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.\n\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\nindistinctness in the causes of her’s, than in his. She did not always\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\nher opinions were right and her adversary’s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He",
        "walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet’s\nstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\nof the young man’s coming to Mrs. Goddard’s that morning, and meeting\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when",
        "Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\nwoman’s friendship and woman’s feelings would not justify.\n\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither",
        "with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\nof Mr. Knightley’s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate",
        "disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree",
        "of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\n\nHarriet’s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard’s to attend a sick child,\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and",
        "found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_",
        "_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal",
        "more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\n“that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton\nhad not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual",
        "before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave\nlooks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not\nrepent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more\njustified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next\nfew days.\n\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\nElton’s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half",
        "sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet’s\nfeelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and\nsteady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was\nsoon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin’s being no otherwise remembered,\nthan as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage\nto the latter.\n\nHer views of improving her little friend’s mind, by a great deal of\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few",
        "first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\nrange and work at Harriet’s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin",
        "quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\nciphers and trophies.\n\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\nnot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard’s, had written\nout at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint\nof it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse’s help, to get a great many\nmore. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as",
        "Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of\nthe first order, in form as well as quantity.\n\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\nin. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.”\nAnd it always ended in “Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.”",
        "His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did\nnot at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had\ndesired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.\n\nIt was by no means his daughter’s wish that the intellects of Highbury\nin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\nwhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really",
        "good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she\nhad the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his\nrecollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most\nearnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe\na compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their\ntwo or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at\nlast he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known\ncharade,",
        "My first doth affliction denote,\n    Which my second is destin’d to feel\nAnd my whole is the best antidote\n    That affliction to soften and heal.—\n\n\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\npages ago already.\n\n“Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?” said she;\n“that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\neasier to you.”\n\n“Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his",
        "life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse”—he\nstopt a moment—“or Miss Smith could inspire him.”\n\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called\nfor a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.",
        "“I do not offer it for Miss Smith’s collection,” said he. “Being my\nfriend’s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.”\n\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it\neasier to meet her eye than her friend’s. He was gone the next\nmoment:—after another moment’s pause,\n\n“Take it,” said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards",
        "Harriet—“it is for you. Take your own.”\n\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\nloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\n\nTo Miss——\n\n\nCHARADE.\n\n\nMy first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\nAnother view of man, my second brings,\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n\nBut ah! united, what reverse we have!\n    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;",
        "Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\n    Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\n    May its approval beam in that soft eye!\n\n\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\nwhile Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope",
        "and dulness, “Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\ncharades. _Courtship_—a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\nis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly—‘Pray, Miss Smith,\ngive me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\nintentions in the same glance.’\n\nMay its approval beam in that soft eye!\n\n\nHarriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets, the\njustest that could be given.\n\nThy ready wit the word will soon supply.",
        "Humph—Harriet’s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\nlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\nyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\nindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\nnow.”\n\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the",
        "eagerness of Harriet’s wondering questions.\n\n“What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an idea—I\ncannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\nit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is\nit kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young\nlady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\n\nAnd woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\n\nCan it be Neptune?\n\nBehold him there, the monarch of the seas!",
        "Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?”\n\n“Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a\nfriend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\n\nFor Miss ———, read Miss Smith.\n\nMy first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,",
        "Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\n\n\nThat is _court_.\n\nAnother view of man, my second brings;\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\n\n\nThat is _ship_;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream.\n\nBut ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\n    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\n\n\nA very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I",
        "think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\nits being written for you and to you.”\n\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the\nconcluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\nEmma spoke for her.\n\n“There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,”",
        "said she, “that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton’s intentions. You\nare his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\nthought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now,\nit is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my\nwishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet,\njust so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that\nhas happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and",
        "Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its\neligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I\ncongratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an\nattachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a\nconnexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing\nthat you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix\nyou in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to",
        "me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance\nwhich can never raise a blush in either of us.”\n\n“Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and “Dear Miss Woodhouse,” was all that Harriet,\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\narrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear\nto her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as\nshe ought. Mr. Elton’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.",
        "“Whatever you say is always right,” cried Harriet, “and therefore I\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses—‘To Miss ———.’\nDear me, how clever!—Could it really be meant for me?”\n\n“I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a",
        "certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the\nplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\nmatter-of-fact prose.”\n\n“It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a\nmonth ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take\nplace!”\n\n“When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so",
        "evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.",
        "The course of true love never did run smooth—\n\n\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\npassage.”\n\n“That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all people,\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;",
        "that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!—The two Abbots and\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look",
        "too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.”\n\n“This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be, must\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\nevery assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same",
        "country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\nthem.”\n\n“Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\nunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\nother. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have",
        "made any thing like it.”\n\n“I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\nyesterday.”\n\n“I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.”\n\n“I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.”\n\n“It is as long again as almost all we have had before.”\n\n“I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\nthings in general cannot be too short.”\n\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.",
        "“It is one thing,” said she, presently—her cheeks in a glow—“to have\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\nthis.”\n\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin’s\nprose.\n\n“Such sweet lines!” continued Harriet—“these two last!—But how shall I",
        "ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?—Oh! Miss\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?”\n\n“Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.”\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful",
        "charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.”\n\n“Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\nnot write it into your book.”\n\n“Oh! but those two lines are”—\n\n—“The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for private\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a",
        "very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\nupon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\nthan his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\nor neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\nbe no possible reflection on you.”\n\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\nas to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a",
        "declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\nof publicity.\n\n“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.\n\n“Very well,” replied Emma; “a most natural feeling; and the longer it\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of",
        "gallantry towards us all!—You must let me read it to him.”\n\nHarriet looked grave.\n\n“My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not",
        "have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\nthis charade.”\n\n“Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “Well, my dears, how does\nyour book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?”",
        "“Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose,\nby a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\nit in.”\n\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\npart as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.",
        "“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. Very true.\n‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\neasily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so\nprettily, but you, Emma.”\n\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very\ntender sigh, he added,\n\n“Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can",
        "remember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\nseveral.\n\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\n    Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\nThe hood-wink’d boy I called to aid,\nThough of his near approach afraid,\n    So fatal to my suit before.\n\n\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.”",
        "“Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick’s, you know.”\n\n“Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.\n\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\n\n\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what\nroom there will be for the children?”",
        "“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\nhas;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you\nknow. Why should there be any change?”\n\n“I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John Knightley’s being a\nlawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away\nfrom us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\nTaylor here!”",
        "“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”\n\n“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\nfirst heard she was going to be married.”\n\n“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\nhere.”\n\n“Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.”\n\n“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of",
        "necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\nthis Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him,\nthan with us.”\n\n“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\nanywhere but at Hartfield.”",
        "Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley’s claims on his\nbrother, or any body’s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\nmusing a little while, and then said,\n\n“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.”\n\n“Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do",
        "not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\nhusband.”\n\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\nby the idea of his daughter’s attachment to her husband, she\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\n\n“Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the",
        "children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?”\n\n“Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.”\n\n“I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.”\n\n“Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,",
        "is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, ‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\nof string?’ and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with",
        "them very often.”\n\n“He appears rough to you,” said Emma, “because you are so very gentle\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\nmisbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\naffectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\nfather. The children are all fond of him.”\n\n“And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\nvery frightful way!”",
        "“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.”\n\n“Well, I cannot understand it.”\n\n“That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.”\n\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\npreparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this",
        "inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\nhis the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and\nshe imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse’s party could be made\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give",
        "way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\ndining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\nconditionally to come.\n\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\npaper from the table, she returned it—\n\n“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;",
        "thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\nventured to write it into Miss Smith’s collection. Your friend will not\ntake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\neight lines.”\n\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\nrather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about\n“honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open\non the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the",
        "view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\n\n“You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\nnot be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.”\n\n“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\na good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying—at least if\nmy friend feels at all as _I_ do—I have not the smallest doubt that,",
        "could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at\nthe book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as\nthe proudest moment of his life.”\n\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a\nsort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and",
        "the sublime of pleasure to Harriet’s share.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\n\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street",
        "of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing",
        "eyes.—Emma’s remark was—\n\n“There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\ndays.”—Harriet’s was—\n\n“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”\n\n“I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded,\n“but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\nthis part of Highbury.”",
        "Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\nElton’s seeing ready wit in her.\n\n“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think of any\ntolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire\nabout of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”",
        "She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again—\n\n“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!”—\n\nEmma laughed, and replied,\n\n“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\nI must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\nintention of ever marrying at all.”",
        "“Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.”\n\n“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.”\n\n“Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”—\n\n“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall",
        "in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\nmistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always",
        "first and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.”\n\n“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”\n\n“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so\nsmiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any",
        "likeness, except in being unmarried.”\n\n“But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!”\n\n“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and",
        "pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very",
        "much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.”\n\n“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\ngrow old?”\n\n“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great",
        "many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman’s\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil",
        "to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.”",
        "“Do you know Miss Bates’s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\na hundred times—but are you acquainted?”\n\n“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter",
        "from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\ntires me to death.”\n\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor",
        "were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she",
        "came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\n\n“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\nevery thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?”",
        "“Very true,” said Harriet. “Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\nelse.”\n\n“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\ninto the lane again. “I do not think it will,” stopping to look once\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\ngreater within.\n\n“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.",
        "They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\ntime only to say farther,\n\n“Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we",
        "can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to\nourselves.”\n\nHarriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman joined\nthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what\ncould be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\naccompany them.",
        "“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma;\n“to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of\nlove on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.”\n\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had",
        "not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet’s habits of\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time",
        "she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\nthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\nfetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,",
        "without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\ninvoluntarily: the child’s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\nto join them.",
        "Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was\nonly giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday’s party at\nhis friend Cole’s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\ncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and\nall the dessert.\n\n“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her",
        "consoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\ncould but have kept longer away!”\n\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\nand fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off",
        "short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged\nto entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself\nto rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\n\n“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I am to\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\nstop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or",
        "string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.”\n\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house\nand endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they\nwere taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\nbehind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\nbetween them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to",
        "receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\nto leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\nElton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\najar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\nadjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\ncould be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and",
        "make her appearance.\n\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\nserious.",
        "“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by inch, and\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”\n\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\nthem forward to the great event.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma’s power",
        "to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\nsister’s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\nand then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\nand during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\nexpected—she did not herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional,\nfortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They\nmight advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow",
        "or other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more\nleisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the\nless they will do for themselves.\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\nfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual\ninterest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had\nbeen divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays",
        "of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it\nwas therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by\ntheir Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not\nbe induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella’s sake; and\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\nforestalling this too short visit.\n\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little",
        "of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\nof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\nthe sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\nKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of\nnursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of\nsuch an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and\nvariously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion",
        "which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\nendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the\nfeelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that\nin spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her\nlittle ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and\nattendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the",
        "children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in\nthemselves or in any restless attendance on them.\n\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so\ntenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher\nties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a",
        "fault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or\nany quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited\nalso much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,\nover-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,\nand was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\nof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,\nand a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.",
        "Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He\nwas not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to\ndeserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;\nand, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that",
        "any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme\nsweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and\nquickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an\nungracious, or say a severe thing.\n\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\nin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\nIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have",
        "passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella’s sister,\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all\nin her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse’s peculiarities and",
        "fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.\nJohn Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and\ngenerally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often\nfor Emma’s charity, especially as there was all the pain of\napprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The\nbeginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest",
        "feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass\naway in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and\ncomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a\nsigh, called his daughter’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield\nsince she had been there last.\n\n“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor—It is a grievous business.”\n\n“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her!",
        "And dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I have been so\ngrieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\nher.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty well, sir.”\n\n“Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that the\nplace agrees with her tolerably.”\n\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\ndoubts of the air of Randalls.\n\n“Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my",
        "life—never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”\n\n“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.\n\n“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.\n\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.”\n\n“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,",
        "have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\neither at Randalls or here—and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy\nway, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body\nmust be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought\nalso to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our",
        "missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which\nis the exact truth.”\n\n“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as I hoped\nit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not\nbe doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\neasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\nnow you have Emma’s account, I hope you will be satisfied.”",
        "“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes, certainly—I cannot deny\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\noften—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.”\n\n“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite\nforget poor Mr. Weston.”\n\n“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the",
        "claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.”\n\n“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.—\n“Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of",
        "Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\nslighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\nnothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\nflying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing",
        "that note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”\n\n“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been here on\nthis occasion—or has he not?”\n\n“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in",
        "nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”\n\n“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father. “He\nwrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—”\n\n“My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.”",
        "“Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought it—and\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\nfly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n28th—and began, ‘My dear Madam,’ but I forget how it went on; and it\nwas signed ‘F. C. Weston Churchill.’—I remember that perfectly.”",
        "“How very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\nKnightley. “I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\nsomething so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents\nand natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\nwith him. To give up one’s child! I really never could think well of\nany body who proposed such a thing to any body else.”",
        "“Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,” observed Mr.\nJohn Knightley coolly. “But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and",
        "playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\naffection, or any thing that home affords.”\n\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and\nhad half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable\nand valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home\nto himself, whence resulted her brother’s disposition to look down on",
        "the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\nimportant.—It had a high claim to forbearance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\nIsabella’s first day. Emma’s sense of right however had decided it; and\nbesides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement",
        "between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\ninvitation.\n\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration\nof friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the",
        "children with her—the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months\nold, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to\nbe danced about in her aunt’s arms. It did assist; for though he began\nwith grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of\nthem all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with\nall the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends\nagain; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and",
        "then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring\nthe baby,\n\n“What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and\nnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.”\n\n“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and\nwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings\nwith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might",
        "always think alike.”\n\n“To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\nwrong.”\n\n“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\nyou were born.”\n\n“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt you were much\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\nnearer?”\n\n“Yes—a good deal _nearer_.”",
        "“But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\nthink differently.”\n\n“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience, and by\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\nold grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.”",
        "“That’s true,” she cried—“very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects\non my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know\nthat Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”\n\n“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer.",
        "“Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with me.”\n\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\nKnightley made his appearance, and “How d’ye do, George?” and “John,\nhow are you?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\ncalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which\nwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the\ngood of the other.\n\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards",
        "entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in\none or the other.\n\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,",
        "and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some\ncurious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\nhome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\nyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\ninteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\npart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a",
        "drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\ndestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\nentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\nmanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\nthing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\neagerness.\n\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.",
        "“My poor dear Isabella,” said he, fondly taking her hand, and\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\nfive children—“How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\nmy dear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—You and I\nwill have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\nhave a little gruel.”",
        "Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both\nthe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as\nherself;—and two basins only were ordered. After a little more\ndiscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being\ntaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of\ngrave reflection,\n\n“It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.”",
        "“Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should not\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\nthe weakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.”",
        "“Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, “I must\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet;\nand he never forgets you.”\n\n“Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?”\n\n“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he\nhas not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to",
        "take care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all\nround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice\nanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.”\n\n“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I\nhave a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.”\n\n“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask",
        "him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\nyou had better let him look at little Bella’s throat.”\n\n“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\nWingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”\n\n“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use",
        "to her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\nspoken to—\n\n“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma, “I\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.”\n\n“Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them\nin most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\nBates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.—They are\nalways so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss",
        "Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they, sir?”\n\n“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\nbad cold about a month ago.”\n\n“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\ngeneral or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”\n\n“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you",
        "mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\naltogether a sickly season.”\n\n“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\nexcept—\n\n“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\nsickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!—and the\nair so bad!”",
        "“No, indeed—_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\nvery superior to most others!—You must not confound us with London in\ngeneral, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but\n_we_ are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of",
        "Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I\nthink you are any of you looking well at present.”\n\n“I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely",
        "free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you\ndo not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes with",
        "affectionate anxiety towards her husband.\n\n“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\nvery far from looking well.”\n\n“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?” cried Mr. John\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\n\n“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\nwell—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\nyou left home.”",
        "“My dear Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray do not concern yourself\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.”\n\n“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,”\ncried Emma, “about your friend Mr. Graham’s intending to have a bailiff\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?”",
        "And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\nworse to hear than Isabella’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\n\n“That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!” said Mrs. John Knightley.—“It is so\nlong since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment",
        "accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\nregret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\ndelightful companion for Emma.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\n\n“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty",
        "kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\nbetter companion than Harriet.”\n\n“I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\nvery accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma’s age.”\n\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied",
        "a great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\nPhilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\ntolerably;—but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth",
        "gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\ndangerous opening.\n\n“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\nwith tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma’s ear expressed, “Ah!\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\ndoes not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would",
        "not talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\nminutes, however, he began with,\n\n“I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\ninstead of coming here.”\n\n“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a\ngreat deal of good.”\n\n“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to",
        "hear you had fixed upon South End.”\n\n“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\na mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\nthe least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\nand his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.”",
        "“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—Perry\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\nby what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\nthe sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have\nconsulted Perry.”\n\n“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how",
        "great it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”\n\n“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all,\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\nill-judged measure.”\n\nEmma’s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had",
        "reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\nbrother-in-law’s breaking out.\n\n“Mr. Perry,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family to\none part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more than",
        "his drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\nsarcastic dryness, “If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.”\n\n“True, true,” cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition—“very\ntrue. That’s a consideration indeed.—But John, as to what I was telling",
        "you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me",
        "your opinion.”\n\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the\nimmediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\nother, prevented any renewal of it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John",
        "Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over\nwhat she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had\nnothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.\nIt was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being much too short.\n\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,",
        "there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\nthe party.\n\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\ncould, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually\nat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on",
        "that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\nto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\nHarriet also.\n\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\nonly persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well\nas the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination being\nconsulted in every thing.\n\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that",
        "Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\nby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\na cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma\ncalled on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with\nregard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:\nMrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,",
        "and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which\nexcluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not\nspeak of her loss without many tears.\n\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\nMr. Elton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at\nlast tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a",
        "most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had\nnot advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she was met by\nMr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on\nslowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the\nrumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he\nmight carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr.\nJohn Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two",
        "eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a\ncountry run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton\nand rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s\ncomplaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often",
        "alarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\nhe exclaimed,\n\n“A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\nWhy does not Perry see her?”\n\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and",
        "care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\nthan not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject,\n\n“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\nshould really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel",
        "the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\ngreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\nElton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\na little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”\n\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;",
        "which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her’s,\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma,\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear\nhim impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied\nwith his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly\nvery cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from",
        "Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet\nevery hour of the evening.\n\n“You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies to Mr. and\nMrs. Weston.”\n\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s only\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had",
        "his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\nhe next looked at her.\n\n“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!—After I had got him\noff so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\nbehind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many men,\nespecially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining",
        "out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing\ngives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in\nlove with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must\ndine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see\nready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”",
        "Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard’s for news of her fair\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he\nsighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of",
        "approbation much in his favour.\n\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\nbegan with—\n\n“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\nplease, every feature works.”\n\n“Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a",
        "great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\nvalue.”\n\n“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.”\n\n“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me\nto be Mr. Elton’s object?”\n\n“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never",
        "occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\nnow.”\n\n“Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!”\n\n“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\nso or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”\n\n“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I",
        "are very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\nin want of counsel. He said no more.\n\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in",
        "spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes",
        "of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\nwhite world in a very short time.\n\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated",
        "nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\ndiscontent.\n\n“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when he\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\nabsurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing",
        "people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people’s not staying\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\nshould deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter",
        "that he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\nanother man’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\nat home.”\n\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no",
        "doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my\nlove,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any\nanswer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\nher lips.\n\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.",
        "Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma\nthought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all\nobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\nindeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\naccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while\ndressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—not better.”\n\n“_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard’s,” said she presently, “was not so",
        "pleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was _my_ answer.”\n\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\nsentiment as he answered.\n\n“Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had\nflattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew",
        "had been given her in the morning.”\n\nEmma smiled and answered—“My visit was of use to the nervous part of\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it\nis a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\nprobably heard.”\n\n“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”\n\n“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party",
        "to-day!”\n\n“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”\n\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\n\n“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold",
        "with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\nrendered a gentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\ncold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!\nsnows a little I see.”\n\n“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good deal of\nit.”",
        "“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable; and\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\nyesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the",
        "worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week.\nNothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\nget away till that very day se’nnight.”\n\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\nsaid only, coolly,\n\n“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”\n\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\nastonished now at Mr. Elton’s spirits for other feelings. Harriet",
        "seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\n\n“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the\ngreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs. Weston\nindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\nhospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\nMr. Weston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten",
        "comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,\nfall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,\n(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your\napprobation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large\nparties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”\n\n“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with\nany body.”\n\n“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had",
        "been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be\npaid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\nenjoyment.”\n\n“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed through\nthe sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\nwalked into Mrs. Weston’s drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose his",
        "joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton\nmust smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\nplace.—Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and",
        "understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour’s uninterrupted\ncommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\nof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not",
        "afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\nthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\ngrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\nMr. Elton’s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\nthat was enjoyable to the utmost.\n\nThe misfortune of Harriet’s cold had been pretty well gone through\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to",
        "give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\nIsabella’s coming, and of Emma’s being to follow, and had indeed just\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\nalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\nand welcome her dear Emma.\n\nEmma’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather",
        "sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\nto her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility\ntowards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\nsuggestion of “Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be",
        "possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\nHarriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for\nher being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and\nso delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for",
        "Harriet’s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\npositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\ngoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\nElton’s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard\nenough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his\nson; she heard the words “my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,” repeated\nseveral times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much",
        "suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but\nbefore she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past\nthat any reviving question from her would have been awkward.\n\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma’s resolution of never\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\nChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\nthought—especially since his father’s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if",
        "she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could",
        "change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\ntheir friends’ imaginations.\n\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton’s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\ncross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly",
        "pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\ndinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\nto her,\n\n“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\nsee two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my",
        "son—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\nhear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting\nFrank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us\nwithin a fortnight.”\n\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\nparty quite complete.\n\n“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since",
        "September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\nJanuary.”\n\n“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\nyourself.”",
        "“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the\nother room. There are secrets in all families, you know)—The case is,\nthat a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\nJanuary; and that Frank’s coming depends upon their being put off. If",
        "they are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\nto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the",
        "upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.”\n\n“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied\nEmma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\nwill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”\n\n“Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at",
        "the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to\nspeak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to be very\nfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any\nbody, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\nway—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\nto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\nthat he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it",
        "to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\ngeneral; and the devil of a temper.”\n\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.—\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\nsecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked",
        "of: “for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter\nstands?”\n\n“Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”\n\n“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the certainty of\ncaprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending",
        "before—“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure; in\nshort, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture on the\ntruth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare\nhim.”\n\n“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied",
        "Isabella: “and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\nthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\nperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any\nthing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she\nnever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\nhave made them!”\n\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have",
        "heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from\nher, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,",
        "was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\nwhom he was always comfortable.\n\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\nsaying,\n\n“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”",
        "“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\nChurchills’ to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”",
        "“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a couple of days,\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\ninto bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\nwants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_’s being under\nsuch restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\nhe likes it.”",
        "“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\none decides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\nevery thing gives way to her.”\n\n“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.",
        "Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\nshe owes nothing at all.”\n\n“My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.",
        "I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\nbe.”\n\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, “I shall not be satisfied, unless\nhe comes.”\n\n“He may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued Mrs.\nWeston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance\nof his coming away from them to visit us.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV",
        "Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea\nhe was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\nvery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and",
        "Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\nwith scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\n\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\nfriendly smiles.\n\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,",
        "lovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?—had she heard any thing about\nher, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.” And\nin this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\nterror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\n\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if",
        "he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\non Harriet’s—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\nagain, for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its",
        "proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear—there was no concealing\nit—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\nWeston to implore her assistance, “Would not she give him her\nsupport?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss",
        "Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard’s till it were certain that Miss\nSmith’s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\npromise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?”\n\n“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I",
        "some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”\n\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston’s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right\nof first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked\nand offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the\npurpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she\nthought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,",
        "removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\n\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,\nwith a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\nWoodhouse:\n\n“This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.",
        "Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\nthrough a storm of snow.”\n\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and\nEmma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.",
        "“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;\nand I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two’s snow\ncan hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one\nis blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the\nother at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\nmidnight.”",
        "Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost",
        "good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\n\n“What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?” was Mr.\nWoodhouse’s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her",
        "representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\n\nHis eldest daughter’s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at",
        "Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\n\n“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\nall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing",
        "that gives me cold.”\n\n“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home,\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.”\n\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;",
        "and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\nleft the room immediately after his brother’s first report of the snow,\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury\nroad—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly",
        "enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\nbut the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\nhim in there being nothing to apprehend.\n\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father’s account, who was\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous",
        "constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—\n\n“Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?”\n\n“I am ready, if the others are.”",
        "“Shall I ring the bell?”\n\n“Yes, do.”\n\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes\nmore, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his\nown house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\n\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.",
        "Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of\nalarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\ndiscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. “He was\nafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\nas they could;” and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very",
        "slow and wait for the other carriage.\n\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\nand that they were to have a tête-à-tête drive. It would not have been\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,",
        "previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston’s good wine, and felt sure that he\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\n\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of",
        "the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\nfound her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\nknown, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and",
        "unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\nreally was so. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must",
        "be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\nreplied,\n\n“I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\nyourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.”\n\n“Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!”—And",
        "he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\n\n“Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.”\n\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at",
        "all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\nfavourable answer.\n\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,",
        "replied,\n\n“It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\nmonth, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\nof observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such",
        "professions.”\n\n“Good Heaven!” cried Mr. Elton, “what can be the meaning of this?—Miss\nSmith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\nexistence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\nsorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my",
        "honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be\ninsinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me.”\n\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of",
        "all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton’s sanguine state of mind, he\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed—\n\n“Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.”\n\n“No, sir,” cried Emma, “it confesses no such thing. So far from having",
        "long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\nshould have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther\nfrom my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you",
        "judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\nSmith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?”\n\n“Never, madam,” cried he, affronted in his turn: “never, I assure you.\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object",
        "to—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\nI received—”\n\n“Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common",
        "acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\npresent.”\n\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite",
        "supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,",
        "all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\nsyllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to\nHartfield.\n\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had\nbeen trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\nLane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in",
        "strange hands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\nfather, as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\ngruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,",
        "except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\nthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet\nreflection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\nand be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow\nof every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every",
        "thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of\nall. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\nwould gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in\nerror—more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\n\n“If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne",
        "any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me—but poor\nHarriet!”\n\nHow she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never\nthought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well as she\ncould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\nmisled.\n\nThe picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the",
        "charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its “ready\nwit”—but then the “soft eyes”—in fact it suited neither; it was a\njumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\nthick-headed nonsense?\n\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others",
        "that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet’s friend.\n\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley",
        "had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little",
        "concerned about the feelings of others.\n\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton’s wanting to pay his\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need",
        "be cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody",
        "else with twenty, or with ten.\n\nBut—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\nhim!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\npresumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking.",
        "Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was",
        "inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend",
        "him to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and",
        "delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\nhers.\n\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite",
        "concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\n\n“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into being very\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done",
        "of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I",
        "could not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer.”\n\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing",
        "resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\ndreadfully.\n\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma’s, though under temporary\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\nspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough",
        "to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\n\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\n\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love\nwith her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\ndisappoint him—that Harriet’s nature should not be of that superior",
        "sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there\ncould be no necessity for any body’s knowing what had passed except the\nthree principals, and especially for her father’s being given a\nmoment’s uneasiness about it.\n\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of\nsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome\nthat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.",
        "The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to",
        "freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No\nintercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\nSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\nMr. Elton’s absenting himself.\n\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\nthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\nsociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well",
        "satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\nout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\nentirely from them,—\n\n“Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?”\n\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his",
        "ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes\nof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still\nsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,\nas made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The",
        "weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\nWoodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\nbehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set\noff, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\nIsabella;—which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\non, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\nbusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.",
        "The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\nElton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\nMr. Elton’s best compliments, “that he was proposing to leave Highbury\nthe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the\npressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\nweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\nvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal",
        "leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\nretain a grateful sense—and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\nhappy to attend to them.”\n\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr. Elton’s absence just at this\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\nwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than",
        "in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\nShe had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not\nmentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,\nas she thought, at first, could not escape her father’s suspicion.\n\nIt did, however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely",
        "to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was\na very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\nand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\ntalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\nwith all her usual promptitude.\n\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\nto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable",
        "that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\nher other complaint before the gentleman’s return. She went to Mrs.\nGoddard’s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\npenance of communication; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy\nall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in\nthe ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself\ngrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all",
        "her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\nsix weeks.\n\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of\nHarriet’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\nherself again.\n\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\nof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\nher friend.",
        "Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\nHarriet’s side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\nany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\nwould have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved\nhim—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\nhave thought it possible.",
        "Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no\ndignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she\nlistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\nunderstanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\nsuperior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence\ncould do.\n\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and",
        "ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father’s claims,\nwas to promote Harriet’s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own\naffection in some better method than by match-making. She got her to\nHartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to\noccupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton",
        "from her thoughts.\n\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\ngeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.\nElton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet’s\nage, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might\nbe made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton’s return,\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of",
        "acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing\nthem.\n\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did, in truth, prove\nherself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it\nappeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\ninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend\nits continuing very long in equal force.",
        "If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\nimagine Harriet’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\nrecollection of him.\n\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\neach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\neffecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\nother, and make the best of it.",
        "Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\nGoddard’s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\nhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\nrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\nfound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\ncure, there could be no true peace for herself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII",
        "Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,\nMrs. Weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of\nexcuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his “very great\nmortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of\ncoming to Randalls at no distant period.”\n\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in\nfact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man",
        "had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\nexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\nany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\nand begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\nsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank’s coming two or three\nmonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better\nweather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay",
        "considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\n\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a\nmore apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\nexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\nto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\n\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about\nMr. Frank Churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at",
        "Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,\nrather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was\ndesirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she\ntook care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as\nwarmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston’s disappointment, as might naturally\nbelong to their friendship.\n\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite",
        "as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement",
        "with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\nuse of Mrs. Weston’s arguments against herself.\n\n“The Churchills are very likely in fault,” said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\n“but I dare say he might come if he would.”\n\n“I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”\n\n“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a",
        "point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”\n\n“How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?”\n\n“I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\nlittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\nhave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural",
        "than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\nproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\ntoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\ncontrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is\nhe?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as\nmuch as that. It is impossible.”\n\n“That’s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your",
        "own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\nto manage.”\n\n“It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\nmoney—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or",
        "other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\nleave the Churchills.”\n\n“Yes, sometimes he can.”\n\n“And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.”\n\n“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that",
        "family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\nChurchill’s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\nat others.”\n\n“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his",
        "father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of mere\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—If he would say so to her at",
        "once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\nopposition made to his going.”\n\n“No,” said Emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some made to his\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\nuse!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to",
        "the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\nhim!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\nloud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?”\n\n“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the",
        "people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.",
        "Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\nlittle minds would bend to his.”\n\n“I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were",
        "to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill’s\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and",
        "regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\ncircumstances, to act up to it.”\n\n“Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.”\n\n“Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his",
        "life.”\n\n“Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their",
        "side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\nwould have been no difficulty now.”\n\n“We shall never agree about him,” cried Emma; “but that is nothing\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man’s",
        "perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.”\n\n“Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of",
        "preserving peace at home and preventing his father’s having any right\nto complain. His letters disgust me.”\n\n“Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.”\n\n“I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s\nplace, but without a mother’s affection to blind her. It is on her\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly",
        "feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\ndid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\nFrench, not in English. He may be very ‘amiable,’ have very good\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy",
        "towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\nhim.”\n\n“You seem determined to think ill of him.”\n\n“Me!—not at all,” replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; “I do not\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\nmerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\nplausible manners.”\n\n“Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure",
        "at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—one object of\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\nof nobody else.”\n\n“You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him",
        "conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”\n\n“My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all\nsubjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,",
        "just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\nthat is my idea of him.”\n\n“And mine,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “is, that if he turn out any\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the\npractised politician, who is to read every body’s character, and make\nevery body’s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to",
        "be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\nnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point.”\n\n“I will say no more about him,” cried Emma, “you turn every thing to\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.”\n\n“Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.”\n\n“But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love",
        "for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.”\n\n“He is a person I never think of from one month’s end to another,” said\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should\nbe angry.\n\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\ndifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of",
        "mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\nhigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she\nhad never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the\nmerit of another.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma’s\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\nnot think that Harriet’s solace or her own sins required more; and she",
        "was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\nreturned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,\nand receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr. Elton is so\ngood to the poor!” she found something else must be done.\n\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was",
        "always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\nloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\nwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\nthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\ntheir scanty comforts.\n\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\nas to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion",
        "of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and all\nthe horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and\ntherefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden\nresolution of not passing their door without going in—observing, as she\nproposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were\njust now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.",
        "The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized\napartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most\ncordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who\nwith her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to\ngive up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking\ndaughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks",
        "for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\nMr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her mother’s, and\nsweet-cake from the beaufet—“Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called\nin for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them,\nand _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she\nliked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss\nSmith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.”",
        "The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\nsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\nletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\nhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he\nwent, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies’ ball had been; and she\nwent through it very well, with all the interest and all the",
        "commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to\nprevent Harriet’s being obliged to say a word.\n\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\nhaving once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\nany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the\nMistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not\nbeen prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was",
        "actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last\nabruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\n\n“Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing—Mrs. Cole was\ntelling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was—Mrs. Cole was so kind\nas to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came\nin, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite\nthere. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her",
        "kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any\nbody can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, ‘I\nknow you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\nfor writing;’ and when I immediately said, ‘But indeed we have, we had\na letter this very morning,’ I do not know that I ever saw any body\nmore surprized. ‘Have you, upon your honour?’ said she; ‘well, that is\nquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.’”",
        "Emma’s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest—\n\n“Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\nhope she is well?”\n\n“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt, while\neagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without\nbeing aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very",
        "lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it\nto Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my\nmother, for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she\ncan never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and\nhere it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to\nwish to hear what she says;—but, first of all, I really must, in\njustice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two",
        "pages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and\ncrosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\nShe often says, when the letter is first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I\nthink you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’—don’t\nyou, ma’am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make\nit out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I\nam sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,",
        "indeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can\nsee amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is\nsuch a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often\nsays, when she is here, ‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very\nstrong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done\ntoo!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’”\n\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;",
        "and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\nFairfax’s handwriting.\n\n“You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; “you\nwho are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure\nthere is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss\nWoodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.\nMa’am,” addressing her, “do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging\nto say about Jane’s handwriting?”",
        "And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\ntwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\npondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\nrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax’s letter, and had almost\nresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\nBates turned to her again and seized her attention.\n\n“My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all. By",
        "only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at\nall deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at\nmy mother’s time of life—and it really is full two years, you know,\nsince she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,",
        "and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough\nof her now.”\n\n“Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?”\n\n“Oh yes; next week.”\n\n“Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure.”\n\n“Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel",
        "Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So\nvery good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you\nknow. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.\nThat is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in\nthe common course, we should not have heard from her before next\nTuesday or Wednesday.”\n\n“Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.”",
        "“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\nfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\nmother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least.\nThree months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\npleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells\nare going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to\ncome over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till",
        "the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she\nmarried, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,\nwhich must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was\ngoing to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very\nurgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know\nwhich it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr.\nDixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,",
        "and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to\ntheir country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has\nheard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know\nthat she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very\nnatural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while\nhe was paying his addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking\nout with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about",
        "their daughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I\ndo not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be\ntelling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she\nwrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views\nthat he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I\nbelieve. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of\nthings.”",
        "At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma’s\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not\ngoing to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\ndiscovery,\n\n“You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\nbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\nexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”",
        "“Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\ndistance from us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was\nto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\nher (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\nthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;",
        "Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a\nmost charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\nWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by\nthe sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would\nhave been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone,\nif he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her\nhabit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we",
        "had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!”\n\n“But, in spite of all her friends’ urgency, and her own wish of seeing\nIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?”\n\n“Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and\nMrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\nair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.”",
        "“I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no\nremarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.”\n\n“Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not.\nThere is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was\nabsolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable.”\n\n“Yes, that of course.”",
        "“Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of\nNovember, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well\nsince. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never\nmentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\nconsiderate!—But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four",
        "months at Highbury will entirely cure her—and it is certainly a great\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.”\n\n“It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.”\n\n“And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—as you will\nfind from Jane’s letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,",
        "what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\nher illness—but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\nlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\nme, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\nto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;",
        "but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\nburst out, quite frightened, with ‘Bless me! poor Jane is ill!’—which\nmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\nat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The",
        "expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife\nand family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well,\nnow I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will\nturn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal\nbetter than I can tell it for her.”",
        "“I am afraid we must be running away,” said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\nand beginning to rise—“My father will be expecting us. I had no\nintention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\npass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\npleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\nmorning.”\n\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained",
        "the street—happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\nagainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\nJane Fairfax’s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates’s youngest\ndaughter.\n\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and Miss\nJane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest;",
        "but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him\ndying in action abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief\nsoon afterwards—and this girl.\n\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the\nconsolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her",
        "being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up\nwith no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\n\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\nto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\nFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and",
        "farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\ncamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\nhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\ndeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing\nin his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took\nnotice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a\ngirl, about Jane’s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long",
        "visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years\nold, his daughter’s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a\nreal friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of\nundertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and\nfrom that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell’s family, and\nhad lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time\nto time.\n\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the",
        "very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of\nColonel Campbell’s power; for though his income, by pay and\nappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\nhis daughter’s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\nsupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\n\nSuch was Jane Fairfax’s history. She had fallen into good hands, known",
        "nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\neducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed\npeople, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of\ndiscipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell’s residence being in\nLondon, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the\nattendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were\nequally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or",
        "nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\ncare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\nbut she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor\nmother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil\nday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\nrational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of",
        "home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\nsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this\nmight soon be over.\n\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell\nin particular, was the more honourable to each party from the\ncircumstance of Jane’s decided superiority both in beauty and\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by",
        "the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till\nthe marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so\noften defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to\nwhat is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\naffections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\nsoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\nwhile Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.",
        "This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\nfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\nhad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\nfrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,",
        "peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\n\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\nresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\nfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\nwould be selfishness:—what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps\nthey began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted",
        "the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such\nenjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,\nhowever, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not\nhurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since\nthe time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\nin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame",
        "and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\nto require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\ndischarged with tolerable comfort.\n\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not\ntold. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with",
        "those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\nor treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\nthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\nrecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she\nwas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\nnovelty which had been so long promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must put",
        "up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\nfreshness of a two years’ absence.\n\nEmma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\nthrough three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and\nless than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she",
        "wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\neagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\nwhich her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never\nget acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\nsuch coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she\npleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she\nwas made such a fuss with by every body!—and it had been always",
        "imagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the\nsame, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.”\nThese were her reasons—she had no better.\n\nIt was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by\nfancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years’",
        "interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\nthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as\nalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\nher figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\nbetween fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed",
        "to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\nthis; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them\naltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\npleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\neyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\nhad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\ndelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,",
        "of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in\nhonour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance, which, whether of\nperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be\nvulgar, was distinction, and merit.\n\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When",
        "she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she\nwas going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so\nnaturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more",
        "pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon’s\naffections from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her\nimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be\nsimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been\nunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\nconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,",
        "might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\nbeginning her career of laborious duty.\n\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that\nshe could wish to scheme about for her.\n\nThese were charming feelings—but not lasting. Before she had committed",
        "herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane\nFairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\nerrors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she\nis better than handsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\nher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\nusual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome\nas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to",
        "admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\nexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\nsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\nnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane’s\noffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\nthanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\naffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off",
        "in higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,\nwhich was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\nat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\ndetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\nreserved.\n\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved\non the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed\nbent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon’s character, or her own",
        "value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It\nwas all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or\ndistinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown\naway. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There\nprobably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr.\nDixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other,\nor been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve",
        "thousand pounds.\n\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\nlittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\nprocure as to what he truly was. “Was he handsome?”—“She believed he\nwas reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he agreeable?”—“He was\ngenerally thought so.” “Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man\nof information?”—“At a watering-place, or in a common London",
        "acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\nmanners pleasing.” Emma could not forgive her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nEmma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was",
        "expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\nMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain\nenough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her\nunjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\n\n“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers",
        "swept away;—“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\nvery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than\nsitting at one’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such\nyoung women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am\nsure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left\nnothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no\ninstrument at her grandmother’s, it must have been a real indulgence.”",
        "“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I am not\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”\n\n“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “_that_ I am sure you are\nnot. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any\nthing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been\nhanded round once, I think it would have been enough.”\n\n“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are not often",
        "deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\nthink you understand me, therefore.”\n\nAn arch look expressed—“I understand you well enough;” but she said\nonly, “Miss Fairfax is reserved.”\n\n“I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be\nhonoured.”\n\n“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”",
        "“My dear Emma,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\n“you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\nevening.”\n\n“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\nand amused to think how little information I obtained.”\n\n“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.\n\n“I hope every body had a pleasant evening,” said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\nquiet way. “I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I",
        "moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\nMiss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\nshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\nBates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\nFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very\nwell-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\nagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.”",
        "“True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.”\n\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\npresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question—\n\n“She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one’s eyes\nfrom. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my\nheart.”\n\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\nexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\nthoughts were on the Bates’s, said—",
        "“It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so little one can\nventure to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon—Now we\nhave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\nit is very small and delicate—Hartfield pork is not like any other\npork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\nof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,",
        "without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear\nroast pork—I think we had better send the leg—do not you think so, my\ndear?”\n\n“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.”\n\n“That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\nthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it",
        "is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\nboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\nlittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”\n\n“Emma,” said Mr. Knightley presently, “I have a piece of news for you.\nYou like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\ninterest you.”\n\n“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile\nso?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?”\n\nHe had time only to say,",
        "“No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,” when the door was\nthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\nof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give\nquickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that\nnot another syllable of communication could rest with him.\n\n“Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse—I\ncome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are",
        "too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\nmarried.”\n\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\ncompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\nlittle blush, at the sound.\n\n“There is my news:—I thought it would interest you,” said Mr.\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\nhad passed between them.\n\n“But where could _you_ hear it?” cried Miss Bates. “Where could you",
        "possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\nreceived Mrs. Cole’s note—no, it cannot be more than five—or at least\nten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out—I\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork—Jane was\nstanding in the passage—were not you, Jane?—for my mother was so afraid\nthat we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down\nand see, and Jane said, ‘Shall I go down instead? for I think you have",
        "a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.’—‘Oh! my dear,’\nsaid I—well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins—that’s all I\nknow. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you\npossibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of\nit, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—”\n\n“I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\nread Elton’s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.”",
        "“Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news more\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\nmother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\nthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.”\n\n“We consider our Hartfield pork,” replied Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed it\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\ncannot have a greater pleasure than—”\n\n“Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to",
        "us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We\nmay well say that ‘our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.’ Well, Mr.\nKnightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well—”\n\n“It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of course.”—\nHere was a sly glance at Emma. “He had been so fortunate as to—I forget\nthe precise words—one has no business to remember them. The information",
        "was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins.\nBy his style, I should imagine it just settled.”\n\n“Mr. Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\n“He will have every body’s wishes for his happiness.”\n\n“He is very young to settle,” was Mr. Woodhouse’s observation. “He had\nbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\nwere always glad to see him at Hartfield.”\n\n“A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!” said Miss Bates,",
        "joyfully; “my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to have\nthe poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.\nJane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a\ncuriosity to see him.”\n\nJane’s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\noccupy her.\n\n“No—I have never seen Mr. Elton,” she replied, starting on this appeal;\n“is he—is he a tall man?”\n\n“Who shall answer that question?” cried Emma. “My father would say",
        "‘yes,’ Mr. Knightley ‘no;’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\nhappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\nyou will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\nHighbury, both in person and mind.”\n\n“Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\nman—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was\nprecisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say, an",
        "excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother—wanting her\nto sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\nmother is a little deaf, you know—it is not much, but she does not hear\nquite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\nfancied bathing might be good for it—the warm bath—but she says it did\nhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\nAnd Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It",
        "is such a happiness when good people get together—and they always do.\nNow, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\nsuch very good people; and the Perrys—I suppose there never was a\nhappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,”\nturning to Mr. Woodhouse, “I think there are few places with such\nsociety as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our\nneighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better",
        "than another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—”\n\n“As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\nwith her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that\nit cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four\nweeks.”\n\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\nEmma said,\n\n“You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an interest\nin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on",
        "these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\nCampbell’s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\nElton and Miss Hawkins.”\n\n“When I have seen Mr. Elton,” replied Jane, “I dare say I shall be\ninterested—but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\nmonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\noff.”\n\n“Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss",
        "Woodhouse,” said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.—A Miss\nHawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady\nhereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but I\nimmediately said, ‘No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man—but’—In\nshort, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of\ndiscoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the\nsame time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired—Miss",
        "Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\noffend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered\nnow. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear\nlittle children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr.\nJohn Knightley. I mean in person—tall, and with that sort of look—and\nnot very talkative.”\n\n“Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”",
        "“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\nnot, strictly speaking, handsome?”\n\n“Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was\nplain.”\n\n“My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\nand that you yourself—”\n\n“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I\nalways think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the",
        "general opinion, when I called him plain.”\n\n“Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather\ndoes not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging,\nmy dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a\nmost agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs.\nCole’s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better\ngo home directly—I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is",
        "the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\nattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares\nfor any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be\nanother thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is\ncoming too. Well, that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired, you will\nbe so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!—Good\nmorning to you.”",
        "Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\nhe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to\nmarry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view\nof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\nof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but\nshe was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that she could\nhope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from",
        "hearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was\nlikely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its\nbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\ndetaining her at Mrs. Goddard’s, and that the intelligence would\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\n\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which",
        "hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “Oh!\nMiss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!” which instantly burst\nforth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow\nwas given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than\nin listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had\nto tell. “She had set out from Mrs. Goddard’s half an hour ago—she had\nbeen afraid it would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every",
        "moment—but she thought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried\non as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where\na young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just\nstep in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\nhalf a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she\ndid not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could,\nand took shelter at Ford’s.”—Ford’s was the principal woollen-draper,",
        "linen-draper, and haberdasher’s shop united; the shop first in size and\nfashion in the place.—“And so, there she had set, without an idea of\nany thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps—when, all of a\nsudden, who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd!—but they\nalways dealt at Ford’s—who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her\nbrother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have\nfainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the",
        "door—Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the\numbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\nno notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and\nI kept sitting near the door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I\nmust have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,\nbecause of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but\nthere.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at last, I fancy, he looked round",
        "and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began\nwhispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I\ncould not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward—came\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake\nhands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she\nused; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to",
        "be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but\nI know no more what I said—I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said\nshe was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear,\nMiss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was\nbeginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me\nfrom getting away—and then—only think!—I found he was coming up towards\nme too—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and",
        "so he came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling\ndreadfully, you know, one can’t tell how; and then I took courage, and\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not\ngot three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I\nwas going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.\nCole’s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this\nrain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I",
        "said, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and\nthen he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables—I\nbelieve I did—but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh!\nMiss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and\nyet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so\npleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do\ntalk to me and make me comfortable again.”",
        "Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\nher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\ncomfortable herself. The young man’s conduct, and his sister’s, seemed\nthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\ndescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded\naffection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed\nthem to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did",
        "this make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed\nby it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry.\nAmbition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all\nhave hoped to rise by Harriet’s acquaintance: and besides, what was the\nvalue of Harriet’s description?—So easily pleased—so little\ndiscerning;—what signified her praise?\n\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by",
        "considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of\nbeing dwelt on,\n\n“It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you seem to\nhave behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may never—can never, as\na first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\nit.”\n\nHarriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about it;” but\nstill she talked of it—still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma,",
        "at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to\nhurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender\ncaution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed\nor only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet—such a\nconclusion of Mr. Elton’s importance with her!\n\nMr. Elton’s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an",
        "hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first\nconversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations\nof curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this\nfortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under\nproper subordination in her fancy.\n\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\nhad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining",
        "any influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\nat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\ncourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\nbrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard’s; and a\ntwelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with\nany necessity, or even any power of speech.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting",
        "situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\nbeing kindly spoken of.\n\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins’s name was first mentioned in\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\nevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant,\nhighly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself\narrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of",
        "her merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her\nChristian name, and say whose music she principally played.\n\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\nmortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\nlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\nhad gone away deeply offended—he came back engaged to another—and to",
        "another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\ncircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back\ngay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss\nWoodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\n\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\nof perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent\nfortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of",
        "some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had\nnot thrown himself away—he had gained a woman of 10,000 _l_. or\nthereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity—the\nfirst hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\ndistinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of\nthe rise and progress of the affair was so glorious—the steps so quick,\nfrom the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green’s, and the",
        "party at Mrs. Brown’s—smiles and blushes rising in importance—with\nconsciousness and agitation richly scattered—the lady had been so\neasily impressed—so sweetly disposed—had in short, to use a most\nintelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, that vanity and\nprudence were equally contented.\n\nHe had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection, and\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his",
        "own concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed at—and,\nwith cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of\nthe place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously\ngallant.\n\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\nplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\nwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which",
        "a certain glance of Mrs. Cole’s did not seem to contradict, that when\nhe next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\n\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the\nimpression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and\npretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very\nmuch to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his",
        "sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable\nfeelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a\nsource of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been\nthankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very\nwell; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would\nadminister most satisfaction.\n\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\ncertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be",
        "prevented—many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be\nan excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\nwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\nagain.\n\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good\nenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for\nHighbury—handsome enough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet’s side. As\nto connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all",
        "his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On\nthat article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be\nuncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the\n10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet’s superior.\nShe brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the\nyoungest of the two daughters of a Bristol—merchant, of course, he must\nbe called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life",
        "appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of\nhis line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she\nhad been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very\nheart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years\nago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly\nhonourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and\nwith him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of",
        "some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the\nconnexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_\n_married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept\ntwo carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory\nof Miss Hawkins.\n\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\ntalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out",
        "of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet’s\nmind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\ncertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\nwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\nher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\nreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him",
        "somewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times\nevery day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss\nhim, _just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have\nsomething occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring\nwarmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually\nhearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always\namong those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so",
        "interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,\ntherefore, every guess—all that had already occurred, all that might\noccur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,\nservants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her\nregard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her\nregrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of\nMiss Hawkins’s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he",
        "seemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of\nhis hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\n\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\nfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet’s mind,\nEmma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\npredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\nas a check to the other. Mr. Elton’s engagement had been the cure of",
        "the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\nknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\nMartin’s calling at Mrs. Goddard’s a few days afterwards. Harriet had\nnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,\nwritten in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a\ngreat deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had\nbeen much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done",
        "in return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.\nElton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the\nMartins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for\nBath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\njudged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin’s visit.\n\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and what\nmight be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.",
        "Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\nbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\nacquaintance—!\n\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\nHarriet’s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\nAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so",
        "soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\nof intimacy was chosen for the future.\n\nShe could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\nwhich her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude, merely\nglossed over—it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her",
        "friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard’s, her evil stars had led her to\nthe very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\nPhilip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\nbeing lifted into the butcher’s cart, which was to convey it to where\nthe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\nand the direction, was consequently a blank.\n\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be",
        "put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\nespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\nhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\nrevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed\nher to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which\ndetermined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of\nan hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old",
        "servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\n\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\nunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\ngravel walk—a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\nher seemingly with ceremonious civility.\n\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\nfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to",
        "understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\nShe had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace\nhad been talked almost all the time—till just at last, when Mrs.\nMartin’s saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was\ngrown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.\nIn that very room she had been measured last September, with her two",
        "friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot\nby the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day,\nthe hour, the party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the\nsame regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and\nthey were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must\nsuspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when\nthe carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and",
        "the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to\nbe given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six\nmonths ago!—Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they\nmight resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business.\nShe would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she",
        "have done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could not repent. They must be\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to\nherself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure\nit. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\n\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that",
        "neither “master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some\ntime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\n\n“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now we shall\njust miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so\ndisappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both—such being\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the",
        "carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who\nwere standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight\nof them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for Mr.\nWeston immediately accosted her with,\n\n“How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father—glad\nto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I had a letter this\nmorning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at",
        "Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\nwish.”\n\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston’s, confirmed as it all was",
        "by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but\nnot less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain\nwas enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice\nin their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted\nspirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was\ncoming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s thought, she hoped Mr.\nElton would now be talked of no more.",
        "Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\nallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his\ncommand, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she\nlistened, and smiled, and congratulated.\n\n“I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.\n\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\nwife.\n\n“We had better move on, Mr. Weston,” said she, “we are detaining the\ngirls.”",
        "“Well, well, I am ready;”—and turning again to Emma, “but you must not\nbe expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\naccount you know; I dare say he is really nothing\nextraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\nspeaking a very different conviction.\n\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\nmanner that appropriated nothing.\n\n“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,” was Mrs.",
        "Weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\nfor her.\n\n“Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three,” was Mr.\nWeston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\nEmma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a\ndifferent air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw",
        "something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\n\n“Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was a\nquestion, however, which did not augur much.\n\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\nwas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\n\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston’s faithful\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that\nshe was to think of her at four.",
        "“My dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental soliloquy, while\nwalking downstairs from her own room, “always overcareful for every\nbody’s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\ngoing again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.” The\nclock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. “’Tis twelve; I\nshall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time\nto-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the",
        "possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\nsoon.”\n\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\nfather—Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of\nFrank’s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the\nmidst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,\nto have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.",
        "The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was\nactually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think too\nmuch had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young\nman; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his\ncountenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his\nfather’s; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that she\nshould like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a",
        "readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be\nacquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\n\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\n\n“I told you yesterday,” cried Mr. Weston with exultation, “I told you\nall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I",
        "used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\nupon one’s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\nmore than any little exertion it needs.”\n\n“It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the young\nman, “though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.”",
        "The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\nconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\nwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\nallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\nHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\nto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but",
        "one’s _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\nhe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\npassed suspiciously through Emma’s brain; but still, if it were a\nfalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner\nhad no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if\nin a state of no common enjoyment.\n\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening",
        "acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,—“Was she a\nhorsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large\nneighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There were\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they balls?—Was\nit a musical society?”\n\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his",
        "mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so\nmuch warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured\nto his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an\nadditional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly\nthinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word\nof praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.\nWeston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He",
        "understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His\nfather’s marriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend\nmust rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a\nblessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest\nobligation on him.”\n\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor’s merits,\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it",
        "was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse’s\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor’s. And at last, as if\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\nher person.\n\n“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he; “but I\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that",
        "I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”\n\n“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,”\nsaid Emma; “were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\nwith pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\nsuch words. Don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a\npretty young woman.”\n\n“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a\ngallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I",
        "might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\nterms.”\n\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\ntheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her\nmind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be\nconsidered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must\nsee more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they\nwere agreeable.",
        "She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\neye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\nexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she\nwas confident that he was often listening.\n\nHer own father’s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from",
        "approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—Though always objecting to\nevery marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the\napprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any\ntwo persons’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\nwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\nnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\nglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all",
        "his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\nFrank Churchill’s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which,\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\nafter another night.\n\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.—“He must be going.",
        "He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\nfor Mrs. Weston at Ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” His\nson, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\n\n“As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\nmay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a\nneighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near",
        "Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\nI suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the\nproper name—I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\nfamily of that name?”\n\n“To be sure we do,” cried his father; “Mrs. Bates—we passed her house—I\nsaw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss\nFairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.\nCall upon her, by all means.”",
        "“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said the young\nman; “another day would do as well; but there was that degree of\nacquaintance at Weymouth which—”\n\n“Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You\nsaw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she",
        "mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely\nenough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.”\n\nThe son looked convinced.\n\n“I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,” said Emma; “she is a very\nelegant young woman.”\n\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a “Yes,” as inclined her almost to\ndoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\nof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought",
        "only ordinarily gifted with it.\n\n“If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,” said\nshe, “I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her\nand hear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has\nan aunt who never holds her tongue.”\n\n“You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?” said Mr.\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; “then give\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young",
        "lady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\nshew you the way.”\n\n“My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.”\n\n“But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many",
        "houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\nhad best cross the street.”\n\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, “My good friend,\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\nit, and as to Mrs. Bates’s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\nstep, and jump.”",
        "They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma\nremained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and\ncould now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,\nwith full confidence in their comfort.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\nWeston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He",
        "had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\ntill her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their\nwalk, immediately fixed on Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very\npleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\nchuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\nwould be his constant attraction.”—Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\nfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction",
        "with him. They walked thither directly.\n\nEmma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\nhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\nnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\narm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\ncompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him",
        "was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\nfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\nwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid\nhis duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole\nmanner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of\nconsidering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there was\ntime enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit",
        "included all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about\ntogether for an hour or two—first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,\nand afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired\nHartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse’s ear; and when their going\nfarther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with\nthe whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much\noftener than Emma could have supposed.",
        "Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\nwhich had been the home of his father’s father; and on recollecting\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must",
        "be very like a merit to those he was with.\n\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\nabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a\nparade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had\nnot done him justice.\n\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses",
        "were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\nrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\nany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\nthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a\nball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\npopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;—but such\nbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for",
        "which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\namong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\ninterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no\nfault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No,",
        "it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the\nformer good old days of the room?—She who could do any thing in\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be",
        "persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when\nparticulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling\nto admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing,\nor that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s\nreturning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a\nyoung man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to",
        "see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the\nhabits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,\ncheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing\nof the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was,\nperhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank,\nbordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however,\nof the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively\nspirits.",
        "At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and\nbeing now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\nrecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\npaid it.\n\n“Yes, oh! yes”—he replied; “I was just going to mention it. A very\nsuccessful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\nobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\nme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I",
        "was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\nwould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;\nand I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him—but\nthere was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I\nfound, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that\nI had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an\nhour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”",
        "“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”\n\n“Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\nLadies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\npale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most\ndeplorable want of complexion.”\n\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\nFairfax’s complexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would",
        "not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness\nand delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character\nof her face.” He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he\nhad heard many people say the same—but yet he must confess, that to him\nnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.\nWhere features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them\nall; and where they were good, the effect was—fortunately he need not",
        "attempt to describe what the effect was.\n\n“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about taste.—At least you\nadmire her except her complexion.”\n\nHe shook his head and laughed.—“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\ncomplexion.”\n\n“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same\nsociety?”\n\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford’s, and he hastily exclaimed,\n“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of",
        "their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\nsays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford’s. If\nit be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\nbuy something at Ford’s. It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say\nthey sell gloves.”\n\n“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will",
        "be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\nyou were Mr. Weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at Ford’s, and your\npopularity will stand upon your own virtues.”\n\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “Men’s Beavers”\nand “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\nsaid—“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\nyou were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_",
        "_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\npublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\nprivate life.”\n\n“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\nparty at Weymouth.”\n\n“And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady’s right to decide on the degree\nof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I",
        "shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”\n\n“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\nher account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\nreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\nbody, that I really think you may say what you like of your\nacquaintance with her.”\n\n“May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so",
        "well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\nlittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\nwarm-hearted woman. I like them all.”\n\n“You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is\ndestined to be?”\n\n“Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.”\n\n“You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling;",
        "“remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\nwhen you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life. I will move a\nlittle farther off.”\n\n“I certainly do forget to think of _her_,” said Emma, “as having ever\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”\n\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\n\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “Did\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?” said Frank\nChurchill.",
        "“Ever hear her!” repeated Emma. “You forget how much she belongs to\nHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\nShe plays charmingly.”\n\n“You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could\nreally judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\nconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am\nexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of\njudging of any body’s performance.—I have been used to hear her’s",
        "admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a\nman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman—engaged to\nher—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to\nsit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\ninstead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\nThat, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.”\n\n“Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.—“Mr. Dixon is very musical,",
        "is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\nvery strong proof.”\n\n“Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\nthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\nto me. I could not excuse a man’s having more music than love—more ear\nthan eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.",
        "How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?”\n\n“It was her very particular friend, you know.”\n\n“Poor comfort!” said Emma, laughing. “One would rather have a stranger\npreferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might\nnot recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor\nMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.”\n\n“You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she",
        "really did not seem to feel it.”\n\n“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be\nit sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or\ndulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt\nit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\ndistinction.”\n\n“As to that—I do not—”\n\n“Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax’s\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human",
        "being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\nwas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.”\n\n“There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all—” he\nbegan rather quickly, but checking himself, added, “however, it is\nimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might\nall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\noutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a",
        "better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\nherself in critical situations, than I can be.”\n\n“I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and\nwomen together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\nintimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\nlittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to",
        "take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always\nwas, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her\nreserve—I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.”\n\n“It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,” said he. “Oftentimes very\nconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\nbut no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.”\n\n“Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction",
        "may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\nagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\nconquering any body’s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\nFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\nill of her—not the least—except that such extreme and perpetual\ncautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\nabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something\nto conceal.”",
        "He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\nthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He\nwas not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in\nsome of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore\nbetter than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate—his\nfeelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of",
        "considering Mr. Elton’s house, which, as well as the church, he would\ngo and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,\nhe could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to\nbe pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,\nhe could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There\nmust be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a\nblockhead who wanted more.",
        "Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking\nabout. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking\nhow many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he\ncould be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small\none. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\nwas talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to\nsettle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not",
        "be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no\nhousekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but no doubt he did\nperfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that\nwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to\nbe allowed an early establishment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nEmma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to",
        "have his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at\nbreakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\nreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\nhaving his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of\nfoppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not\naccord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even",
        "the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to\ndiscern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\nrestlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\nliable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and\nthought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was",
        "clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making\nno other comment than that “all young people would have their little\nwhims.”\n\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was\nvery ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\nhimself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\nappeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and",
        "lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great\ndeal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond\nof talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to",
        "denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of\nbeing at least very near it, and saved only by her own\nindifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\nacquaintance.\n\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have\nsome weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her",
        "extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\nmuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\nharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their\nlittle whims.”\n\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\nleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\nof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were\nmade for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who",
        "smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them\nnot to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles—Mr.\nKnightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,\nhe was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to\nhimself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! just the trifling,\nsilly fellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an\ninstant’s observation convinced her that it was really said only to",
        "relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she\nlet it pass.\n\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make\nEmma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted\nexactly the advice they gave.\n\nThis was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in",
        "Highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in\ntrade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the\ncountry, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping\nlittle company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two\nhad brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.",
        "With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,\ntheir inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their\nnumber of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time\nwere, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at\nHartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared\nevery body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly\namong the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best",
        "families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither\nDonwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,\nif they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be\ngiving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were\nvery respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was\nnot for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would\nvisit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only",
        "from herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\n\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\nbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\nvery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\ninvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\nWeston’s accounting for it with “I suppose they will not take the\nliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite",
        "sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled\nthere, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,\noccurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been\ntempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the\nBateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the\nday before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her",
        "absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of\nhis. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her\nspirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the\nomission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\n\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\nHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\nfirst remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,”",
        "she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\n\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without\ninclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\nproperly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much\nconsideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from",
        "London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\nair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\nof his company.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\nbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without\nneglecting his comfort—how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,\nmight be depended on for bearing him company—Mr. Woodhouse was to be\ntalked into an acquiescence of his daughter’s going out to dinner on a",
        "day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As\nfor _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours\nwould be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well\nresigned.\n\n“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he—“I never was. No more is\nEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\nshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\nin one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in",
        "their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\nreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\nevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\nbody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\nwith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to\ntake care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be\nwhat it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs.",
        "Weston, with a look of gentle reproach—“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\nmarried, you would have staid at home with me.”\n\n“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\nincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.”\n\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not\nlessening, Mr. Woodhouse’s agitation. The ladies knew better how to",
        "allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\narranged.\n\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\nas usual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great\nregard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her.\nJames could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer\nwritten to Mrs. Cole.”\n\n“You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will",
        "say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\ndecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of\ncourse. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is\nto be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will\nbe wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have\nnever been there above once since the new approach was made; but still\nI have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get",
        "there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you\nagain; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying\nlate. You will get very tired when tea is over.”\n\n“But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?”\n\n“Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great\nmany people talking at once. You will not like the noise.”\n\n“But, my dear sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “if Emma comes away early, it\nwill be breaking up the party.”",
        "“And no great harm if it does,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “The sooner every\nparty breaks up, the better.”\n\n“But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma’s going\naway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel\nthat any body’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\nWoodhouse’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person’s",
        "in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I\nam sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\nbeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.”\n\n“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you\nfor reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\npain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\nnever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but",
        "he is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of\ngiving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\nrather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\nlittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\nwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.”\n\n“Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am",
        "only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not\nbeing exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\nknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\nyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of\nthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\nup.”\n\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if\nshe came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if",
        "hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\nsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\nthing were safe in the house, as usual.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\nfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any\nimperfection which could be concealed.",
        "He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\ngood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\ndone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any\nconfusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his\nspirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after\nseeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:—\n\n“I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do",
        "cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\nway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.—It\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\n_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been\nashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a\ncoxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own",
        "vanities.—No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.”\n\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a\nlonger time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\ninference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\nhow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\nand of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\nnow seeing them together for the first time.",
        "She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\nCole’s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\nhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\n\nHer father’s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\nthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after",
        "dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\ndress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\nthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\nunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\nthem to practise during the meal.—She had provided a plentiful dinner\nfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\nit.\n\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole’s door; and was pleased to",
        "see that it was Mr. Knightley’s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\nhaving little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\nindependence, was too apt, in Emma’s opinion, to get about as he could,\nand not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\nShe had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\nher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\n\n“This is coming as you should do,” said she; “like a gentleman.—I am\nquite glad to see you.”",
        "He thanked her, observing, “How lucky that we should arrive at the same\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You\nmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.”\n\n“Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\nbeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but",
        "with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I\nalways observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_\nyou have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed\nashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_\nI shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.”\n\n“Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.\n\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as",
        "with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\nnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When\nthe Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\nadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\nher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\nand at dinner she found him seated by her—and, as she firmly believed,\nnot without some dexterity on his side.",
        "The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox’s family,\nthe lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at\ndinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could",
        "fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her\nneighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to\nattend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating\nsomething of her that was expected to be very interesting. She\nlistened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of\nEmma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that\nshe had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room",
        "had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking\ninstrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and\nexplanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived\nfrom Broadwood’s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt\nand niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates’s account,",
        "Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\npossibly have ordered it—but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\nthat it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from\nColonel Campbell.\n\n“One can suppose nothing else,” added Mrs. Cole, “and I was only\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\nhad a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\nShe knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as",
        "any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\nto surprize her.”\n\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\nenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\nlisten to Mrs. Cole.\n\n“I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me",
        "more satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a\nshame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\ninstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a\nslap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I\nreally was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\ndrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little",
        "girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\nit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr.\nCole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\nparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in\nthe purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so",
        "obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\nreally is the reason why the instrument was bought—or else I am sure we\nought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\nmay be prevailed with to try it this evening.”\n\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole’s, turned\nto Frank Churchill.\n\n“Why do you smile?” said she.\n\n“Nay, why do you?”",
        "“Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell’s being so rich\nand so liberal.—It is a handsome present.”\n\n“Very.”\n\n“I rather wonder that it was never made before.”\n\n“Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”\n\n“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must\nnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”\n\n“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\nBates’s house.”",
        "“You may _say_ what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your\n_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.”\n\n“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\nthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\nbe?”\n\n“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”",
        "“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She\nmust know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;\nand perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a\nyoung woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare\nsay. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.”\n\n“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\nthem.”\n\n“Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the",
        "joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day,\nyou know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”\n\n“Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\nentertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\nof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting\neither that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the\nmisfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a",
        "little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without\nguessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular\ncause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the\nCampbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and\npenance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of\ntrying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer\nit might have passed; but what can any body’s native air do for them in",
        "the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages\nwould be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and\nI dare say in her’s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell\nyou what they are.”\n\n“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon’s\npreference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for being very\ndecided.”",
        "“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?—A water party;\nand by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.”\n\n“He did. I was there—one of the party.”\n\n“Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for it\nseems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I should\nhave made some discoveries.”\n\n“I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon",
        "caught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe\nit was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that\nwas too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\nobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\ndiscoveries.”\n\nThe conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in\nthe awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and",
        "obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the\ntable was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\nexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma\nsaid,\n\n“The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a\nlittle more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\nsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.”\n\n“And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must",
        "conclude it to come from the Campbells.”\n\n“No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\nnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\nwould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\nconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\nDixon is a principal in the business.”\n\n“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed",
        "you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\npaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\nBut when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that\nit should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see\nit in no other light than as an offering of love.”\n\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction\nseemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other",
        "subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the\ndessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired\namid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few\ndownright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor\nthe other—nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old\nnews, and heavy jokes.\n\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other",
        "ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\nof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\ndignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\nthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\ncheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\nalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\naffection. There she sat—and who would have guessed how many tears she",
        "had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\nseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\nnothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\ndid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad\nto change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\nmortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\nvain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself",
        "beloved by the husband of her friend.\n\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\nsecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\nand therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\nsubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\nconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of",
        "guilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend Colonel\nCampbell.”\n\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by\nthe circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\nto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\nof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\nfair heroine’s countenance.",
        "They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of\nthe early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\nhandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\nand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the\ncircle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\nwould not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be\nthinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She",
        "introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\nafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so\nlovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.” And she, “Only to\nbe sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think\nthere were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her\nindignation, and only turned from her in silence.\n\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first",
        "glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated\nsitting long—was always the first to move when he could—that his\nfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\nparish business—that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\npleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of\ngentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury",
        "altogether—thought it so abundant in agreeable families—that Emma began\nto feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much. She\nquestioned him as to the society in Yorkshire—the extent of the\nneighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his\nanswers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little\ngoing on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,\nnone very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations",
        "accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health\nand spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\nperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not\nwithout difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he\ncould get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.\n\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\nits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement",
        "at home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He\ndid not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded\nhis aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and\nnoticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he\ncould _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on\nwhich his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much\nto go abroad—had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she",
        "would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he\nsaid, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\n\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\ngood behaviour to his father.\n\n“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.—\n“I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I never knew days fly\nso fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But\njust got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!—I hate the",
        "recollection.”\n\n“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\nof so few, in having your hair cut.”\n\n“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have no\npleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\nseen.”\n\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\nWhen Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as",
        "before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at\nMiss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\n\n“What is the matter?” said she.\n\nHe started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I believe I have\nbeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\nway—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\nany thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own. I\nsee nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is",
        "an Irish fashion. Shall I?—Yes, I will—I declare I will—and you shall\nsee how she takes it;—whether she colours.”\n\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as\nhe had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\nfront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\n\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.",
        "“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:—“one can get near\nevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to\nyou. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\nMiss Bates and her niece came here?”\n\n“How?—They were invited, were not they?”\n\n“Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their\ncoming?”\n\n“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”",
        "“Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it\nwould be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\ncold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may",
        "guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I\nmade my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage\nwould be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would\nbe making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as\npossible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as\nherself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble\nus, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was to take them home",
        "again.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really quite\nsurprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an\nattention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in\nshort, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do\nsuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it\nwas only as an excuse for assisting them.”",
        "“Very likely,” said Emma—“nothing more likely. I know no man more\nlikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any thing\nreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\nFairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for\nan act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\nmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day—for we arrived",
        "together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\ncould betray.”\n\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more\nsimple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while\nMiss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have\nnever been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more\nprobable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.\nKnightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you",
        "company!—What do you say to it?”\n\n“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs. Weston,\nhow could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr. Knightley must\nnot marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh!\nno, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr.\nKnightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am\namazed that you should think of such a thing.”\n\n“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not",
        "want the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea\nhas been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished\nto marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of\nsix years old, who knows nothing of the matter?”\n\n“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr. Knightley\nmarry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.\nAnd Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”",
        "“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\nknow.”\n\n“But the imprudence of such a match!”\n\n“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”\n\n“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\nbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for\nthe Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax—and is always glad",
        "to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to\nmatch-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the\nAbbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not\nhave him do so mad a thing.”\n\n“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”\n\n“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the",
        "least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He\nis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\nhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\nhis brother’s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\nhis time or his heart.”\n\n“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\nloves Jane Fairfax—”\n\n“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I",
        "am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but—”\n\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could\ndo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”\n\n“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\nBates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\nhim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind",
        "and obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And\nthen fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat.\n‘Not that it was such a very old petticoat either—for still it would\nlast a great while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their\npetticoats were all very strong.’”\n\n“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my\nconscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be",
        "much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She\nmight talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only\ntalk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it\nwould be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think\nhe does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of\nJane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—his anxiety about her\nhealth—his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have",
        "heard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of\nher performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him\nsay that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost\nforgotten one idea that occurred to me—this pianoforte that has been\nsent here by somebody—though we have all been so well satisfied to\nconsider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.\nKnightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person",
        "to do it, even without being in love.”\n\n“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\nnothing mysteriously.”\n\n“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\noftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\ncourse of things, occur to him.”\n\n“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\nher so.”",
        "“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very\nstrong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly\nsilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.”\n\n“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\nmany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment—I\nbelieve nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that\nMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”",
        "They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the\nmost used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed\nthem that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;—and at the\nsame moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do\nthem the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the\neagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing",
        "nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.\nCole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it\nsuited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.\n\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more\nthan she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit\nin the little things which are generally acceptable, and could\naccompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her",
        "agreeably by surprize—a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank\nChurchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and\nevery thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful\nvoice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and\nthat he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly\nasserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her\nplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,",
        "she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely\nsuperior to her own.\n\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\nEmma’s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\nMrs. Weston’s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united",
        "voices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.\nKnightley’s marrying did not in the least subside. She could see\nnothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John\nKnightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children—a\nmost mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great\ndeduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.",
        "Knightley for them all to give way to!—No—Mr. Knightley must never\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\n\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\ntalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\nvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\nstruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\nkindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in",
        "the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate\nonly his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\n\n“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our carriage\nmore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should\nput-to for such a purpose.”\n\n“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he\nreplied;—“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he smiled with",
        "such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\nstep.\n\n“This present from the Campbells,” said she—“this pianoforte is very\nkindly given.”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent\nembarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her\nnotice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\nenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\nexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.”",
        "From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\nhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely\nfree from peculiar attachment—whether there were no actual\npreference—remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane’s\nsecond song, her voice grew thick.\n\n“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—“you have\nsung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.”\n\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;—they would not",
        "fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.”\nAnd Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could manage this\nwithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\nsong falls on the second.”\n\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\n\n“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off\nhis own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates, who at that\nmoment passed near—“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing",
        "herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\nher.”\n\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be\ngrateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\nsinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss\nWoodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but\nsoon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing—originating nobody\nexactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,",
        "that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.\nWeston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an\nirresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming\ngallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\n\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\nvoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.",
        "Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\nwere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\nsomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to\nMrs. Cole—he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody\nelse, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\n\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\nshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than",
        "five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it\nmade it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\npartner. They were a couple worth looking at.\n\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\ngrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her\nmother’s account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to\nbegin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,\nand have done.",
        "“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\nher carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\nafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\nmight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\nbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted",
        "the Coles—worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!—And left a name\nbehind her that would not soon die away.\n\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\npoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\ntransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\nJane Fairfax’s feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\nhad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his",
        "submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,\nwhich made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to\nhave held her tongue.\n\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\nthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret\nthe inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\ngrieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and practised\nvigorously an hour and a half.",
        "She was then interrupted by Harriet’s coming in; and if Harriet’s\npraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\n\n“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”\n\n“Don’t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her’s,\nthan a lamp is like sunshine.”\n\n“Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\nas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\nlast night said how well you played.”",
        "“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\nbut Jane Fairfax’s is much beyond it.”\n\n“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\nsaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great\ndeal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than\nexecution.”",
        "“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”\n\n“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\nknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\nteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\nany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?”\n\n“Just as they always do—very vulgar.”",
        "“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly; “but it is\nnothing of any consequence.”\n\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\nproducing Mr. Elton.\n\n“They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay\nto dinner.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay",
        "there again next summer.”\n\n“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\nbe.”\n\n“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her\nat dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to\nmarry him.”\n\n“Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\ngirls in Highbury.”\n\nHarriet had business at Ford’s.—Emma thought it most prudent to go with\nher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in",
        "her present state, would be dangerous.\n\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.—Much could\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr.\nPerry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\noffice-door, Mr. Cole’s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a",
        "stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\ncould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher\nwith his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her\nfull basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of\ndawdling children round the baker’s little bow-window eyeing the\ngingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused\nenough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at",
        "ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not\nanswer.\n\nShe looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\nappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\nHighbury;—to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates’s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls\nthan Ford’s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\neye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the",
        "agreeableness of yesterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure\nto the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to\ncall on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\n\n“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss\nBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\nmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\nam going now.”",
        "“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said\nFrank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield—if\nyou are going home.”\n\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\n\n“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.”\n\n“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in the\nway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt\nalways sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to",
        "death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.\nWhat am I to do?”\n\n“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only waiting for\nmy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\nBut you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”\n\n“Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\nhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\nindifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.",
        "Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would\nbe palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the\nworld at a civil falsehood.”\n\n“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.—“I am persuaded that\nyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\nthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\notherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax’s opinion last night.”",
        "“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very disagreeable to\nyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We\nwill follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\nwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.”\n\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates’s door. Emma watched them in,\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all",
        "the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\nit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\nlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\n\n“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard’s, ma’am?” asked Mrs.\nFord.—“Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard’s. Only my pattern gown is at\nHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,",
        "Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown\nhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go\nto Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\nMrs. Ford, could not you?”\n\n“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\nparcels.”\n\n“No more it is.”\n\n“No trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\n\n“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you",
        "please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s—I do not know—No, I\nthink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield,\nand take it home with me at night. What do you advise?”\n\n“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.”\n\n“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should\nnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard’s.”\n\nVoices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.",
        "Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\n\n“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run across to\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\ndo you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston\nto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”\n\n“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—”\n\n“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;",
        "and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad\nto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh!\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\nvery happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\nrefuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss Woodhouse’s\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.’—But, said I, I shall",
        "be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said\nhe, ‘wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet\ncame out, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had\nno use of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane",
        "said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I\ndid, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one\nthing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time\nPatty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh,\nsaid I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet\nof your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home,\nMrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging",
        "to us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say that Mrs.\nWallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never\nknown any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be\nfor the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,\nyou know? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really\neats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite\nfrightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she",
        "eats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But\nabout the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she\nlikes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\nfor I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I\nhappened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before—I\nhave so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it\nis the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly",
        "wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an\nexcellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I\nhope, and these ladies will oblige us.”\n\nEmma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they did at\nlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\n\n“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\nI hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane",
        "came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a\nlittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”\n\n“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all\nin the street.\n\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\n\n“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my mother’s\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I\ndo think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind",
        "excessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘Oh!’\nsaid he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\nexcessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so",
        "very obliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is\nnothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the\nfinest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you\nknow, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no\ncompliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis\ndoes them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice,\nand Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but",
        "Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\nfrom Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends us a\nsack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\nanywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother\nsays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was\nreally quite shocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one",
        "morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and\nsaid how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to\nthe end of our stock. ‘I am sure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will\nsend you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever\nuse. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this\nyear. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.’ So\nI begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone, I could not",
        "absolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen\nindeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all\nbear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been\nalready; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost\nquarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a\nquarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\napples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a",
        "great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.\nHowever, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large\nbasket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was\nvery much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said\nevery thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old\nacquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found\nafterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of",
        "_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his master\nhad not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it\nhimself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for\nWilliam, you know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing;\nbut Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent\naway. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have\nanother apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not",
        "mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.\nHodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were\nsold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me,\nand I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\nto keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\nbefore I was aware.”",
        "Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\n\n“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and\nnarrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\nWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\nSmith, the step at the turning.”",
        "CHAPTER X\n\n\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\ntranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\n\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\nhappy countenance on seeing Emma again.",
        "“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least\nten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”\n\n“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not\nearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”\n\n“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I have been\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,",
        "it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to\nbe persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”\n\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to\nmake her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite\nready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately",
        "ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had\nnot yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without\nemotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and\nEmma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could\nnot but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\n\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.",
        "Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined\nher in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\n\n“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with a\nsmile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\nColonel Campbell’s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would",
        "particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\nfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not\nyou think so?”\n\nJane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\nbeen speaking to her at the same moment.\n\n“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. Do\nnot distress her.”\n\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\ndoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,",
        "“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on\nthis occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and\nwonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s\ncoming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to\nbe going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the\nconsequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have\nsent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to",
        "depend upon contingencies and conveniences?”\n\nHe paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\n\n“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice of\nforced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\nall conjecture.”\n\n“Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at",
        "work, if one talks at all;—your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—Miss\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have\nthe pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,\nhealed for the present.”\n\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.",
        "“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the waltzes we\ndanced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds—all the worlds one ever\nhas to give—for another half-hour.”\n\nShe played.\n\n“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\nhappy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”",
        "She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\nsomething else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\nand turning to Emma, said,\n\n“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here\nare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\nexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\nColonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music",
        "here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”\n\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the\nremains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of\nconsciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less",
        "scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to\nher.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently\ncherishing very reprehensible feelings.\n\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.—Emma\ntook the opportunity of whispering,\n\n“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”\n\n“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\nashamed of my meaning.”\n\n“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the\nidea.”",
        "“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\na key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\nwrong, she ought to feel it.”\n\n“She is not entirely without it, I think.”\n\n“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\nmoment—_his_ favourite.”\n\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\nKnightley on horse-back not far off.\n\n“Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to",
        "thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\nbut I can go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in\nwhen he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\nso!—Our little room so honoured!”\n\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley’s attention, and every\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others,",
        "as if it had passed within the same apartment.\n\n“How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\nfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\nfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”\n\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\nhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\n\n“How is your niece, Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all, but",
        "particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold\nlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”\n\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\nher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\nEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\nsteady scepticism.\n\n“So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage,”\nresumed Miss Bates.\n\nHe cut her short with,",
        "“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”\n\n“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\nwanted something from Kingston.”\n\n“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?”\n\n“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new\npianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”\n\n“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”",
        "“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful;\nso many friends!”\n\n“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\nto Kingston as fast as I can.”\n\n“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”\n\n“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear\nthe pianoforte.”\n\n“Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\nnight; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not",
        "it delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\nthing equal to it.”\n\n“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\nAnd (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\nnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\nWeston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in",
        "England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\nsomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\nhear it.”\n\n“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so\nshocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”\n\n“What is the matter now?”\n\n“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a\ngreat many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!",
        "Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to\nthe room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.\nHe is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....”\n\n“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.”",
        "“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\nhave heard every thing to be sure. ‘Can I do any thing for you at\nKingston?’ said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must\nyou be going?—You seem but just come—so very obliging of you.”\n\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\nlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to",
        "be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\nallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\ngates, before they set off for Randalls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\nknown of young people passing many, many months successively, without\nbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\neither to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the",
        "felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt—it\nmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\n\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\npeople in schemes on the subject. Frank’s was the first idea; and his\nthe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of",
        "the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and\nappearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people\nagain how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse\ndanced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself\nwith Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any of\nthe wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room\nthey were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking",
        "the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in\nspite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,\nthat it was a little the largest.\n\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole’s\nshould be finished there—that the same party should be collected, and\nthe same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\nWeston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston",
        "most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\nand the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly\nwho there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of\nspace to every couple.\n\n“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\nCoxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be the\ntwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.",
        "Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\nMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\ncouple there will be plenty of room.”\n\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\n\n“But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think\nthere will.”\n\nOn another,\n\n“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.",
        "It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\nthought of the moment.”\n\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother’s, and\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\nwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\nput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one\nfamily of cousins who must be included, and another of very old",
        "acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the\nfive couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation\nin what possible manner they could be disposed of.\n\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not\nthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the best\nscheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\nbetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress",
        "about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score\nof health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\npersevered in.\n\n“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\nbear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\nSo would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\nbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do",
        "not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\nthoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\nthe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and\nkeeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\ndraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\nquite the thing!”\n\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it,\nand said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now",
        "closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\nin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\nFrank Churchill’s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour\nbefore had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now\nendeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.\n\n“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\ncouple may stand here very well.”\n\nEmma demurred. “It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be",
        "worse than dancing without space to turn in?”\n\n“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went\non measuring, and still he ended with,\n\n“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”\n\n“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\nto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to\nbe dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room!”\n\n“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A",
        "crowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\npictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still, however,\nhaving proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It\nwould be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—I do not know\nthat—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very\nwell.”\n\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of",
        "dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\nHad she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\npause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\nand the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\nacquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\n\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of",
        "the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\n\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your inclination\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\nof my father’s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a\nthought of my father’s, which waits only your approbation to be acted\nupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\nof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the",
        "Crown Inn?”\n\n“The Crown!”\n\n“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you\ncannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him\nthere. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less\ngrateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees\nno objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all\nfeel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the\nRandalls rooms, would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how",
        "right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_\n_thing_ to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?—You consent—I hope\nyou consent?”\n\n“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\nmyself, shall be most happy—It seems the only improvement that could\nbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?”\n\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully",
        "comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\nnecessary to make it acceptable.\n\n“No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much\nworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\nnever properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\nhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the\nCrown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh!",
        "no—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than\nanywhere.”\n\n“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that one of the\ngreat recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of\nany body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the Crown than at\nRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\nnobody else could.”\n\n“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken",
        "if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\nthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father’s house.”\n\n“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\noccasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it\nis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\nheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”",
        "“Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\nheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure, neither\nyour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\nit.”\n\n“Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\nwindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I\nhave often known it done myself.”",
        "“Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\nlive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\nover—but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\nobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\ncan be done.”\n\n“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—”",
        "“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for talking every\nthing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\nthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will\nbe so near their own stable.”\n\n“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\nbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs. Stokes to be",
        "trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”\n\n“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\nunder Mrs. Weston’s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.”\n\n“There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\nis carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\nyears ago, when I had the measles? ‘If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\nwrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ How often have I",
        "heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”\n\n“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would\nhave been very bad, but for Perry’s great attention. He came four times\na day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good\nsort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful\ncomplaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella’s little ones have the\nmeasles, she will send for Perry.”",
        "“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said Frank\nChurchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\nand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\ndesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them,\nif you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\nsatisfactorily without you.”",
        "Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\nset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\nvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and\nhe, finding every thing perfect.\n\n“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places",
        "you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”\n\n“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What does all\nthat signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\nclub-nights.”\n\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know\nwhen things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each",
        "to himself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless\ncares.”\n\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It\nregarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom’s being built,\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\nthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\nas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by\ntheir four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable",
        "supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\npurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\npassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\nWeston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and\nneither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\nmiserably crowded at supper.\n\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c.,",
        "set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\nsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\npronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.\nWeston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\nexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n\n“I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.”\n\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\nthrough the passage, was calling out,",
        "“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”\n\n“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our\nguests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally\npleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.”\n\n“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your neighbours’\nopinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief",
        "of them—the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\nupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.—And I do not know\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\nthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger\ncouncil. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?”\n\n“Well—if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, “if you think\nshe will be of any use.”\n\n“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma. “She",
        "will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\nwill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in\nconsulting Miss Bates.”\n\n“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”\n\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\nhis decided approbation.\n\n“Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at",
        "once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a\nproperer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss\nBates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of\nhow to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.”\n\n“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...\n\n“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a\ngreat blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”\n\n“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.",
        "Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.”\nAnd away he ran.\n\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving\naunt, and her elegant niece,—Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman\nand a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of\nit much less than she had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and\nhere ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation",
        "at least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\nchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\nas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\nStokes.—Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\nwritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\nwhich could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\nbe.",
        "Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As\na counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\ncharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and\nminute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\nhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different\nrooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of\nthe future. The party did not break up without Emma’s being positively",
        "secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor\nwithout her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, “He has asked\nher, my dear. That’s right. I knew he would!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\nsatisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term\nof Frank Churchill’s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston’s\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the",
        "Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\nfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\ntheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\nentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\nhoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion, the great risk, of\nits being all in vain.\n\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His",
        "wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not\nopposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\nsolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of\nher ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley’s provoking\nindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\nbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed\nresolved that it should not interest him, determined against its",
        "exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\nTo her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\nthan,\n\n“Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\nagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh! yes, I\nmust be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I\ncan; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins’s",
        "week’s account; much rather, I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not\nI, indeed—I never look at it—I do not know who does.—Fine dancing, I\nbelieve, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by\nare usually thinking of something very different.”\n\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was\nnot in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,\nor so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the",
        "ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.\nIt made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\nWhat a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\n_very_ great pleasure.”\n\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\npreferred the society of William Larkins. No!—she was more and more\nconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There",
        "was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his\nside—but no love.\n\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\ndays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\nevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew’s\ninstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without\nhim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when",
        "writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\nunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\nherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\nand must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\n\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\nWeston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\nwithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,",
        "to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred\nbut for her own convenience.\n\nMrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom\nhe could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\nexpected at Hartfield very soon.”\n\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma’s breakfast. When once it had\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The",
        "loss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man\nmight be feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it\nwould have been!—Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\nhappiest!—“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.\n\nHer father’s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\nMrs. Churchill’s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and\nas for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but",
        "they would all be safer at home.\n\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if\nthis reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total\nwant of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going\naway almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\nsat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\nhimself, it was only to say,\n\n“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”",
        "“But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your only visit\nto Randalls.”\n\n“Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to\nreturn!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my\nthoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but\nI am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am afraid it is a custom\ngone for ever.”\n\n“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”\n\n“Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the",
        "pleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\nfoolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\nwhy are you always so right?”\n\n“Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\nrather have been merry than wise.”\n\n“If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\non it. Do not forget your engagement.”\n\nEmma looked graciously.\n\n“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more",
        "precious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me\nless fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\nHighbury!”\n\n“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing, “I will\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\ncoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”",
        "He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\nwas convinced that it had been so.\n\n“And you must be off this very morning?”\n\n“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will\nbring him.”\n\n“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates’s powerful, argumentative mind might\nhave strengthened yours.”",
        "“Yes—I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\nwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\nby Miss Bates’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\nto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\nlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay\nmy visit, then”—\n\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\n\n“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can hardly be",
        "quite without suspicion”—\n\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\nwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\nserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,\nin the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\n\n“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\nthen”—\n\nHe was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard",
        "him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\nHe could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\npassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\n\n“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given\nto Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”—\n\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—He was more\nin love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might",
        "have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\nsoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\n\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\nWeston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\nprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\nwas doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he\nmight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.",
        "“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. I\nshall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\nMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\ninterested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters\nI shall be at dear Highbury again.”\n\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed",
        "the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had\nbeen the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so\nsorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from\nhis absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it\ntoo much.\n\nIt was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\narrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the\nlast two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of",
        "seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\nattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\nfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\ncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he\nhad _almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what\nconstancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but\nat present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,",
        "a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all\nthe rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him,\nin spite of every previous determination against it.\n\n“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of listlessness,\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ\nmyself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the\nhouse!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world",
        "if I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always\ngood to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not\nfor Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the\nevening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.”\n\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not\nsay that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would\nhave contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that",
        "he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with\nconsiderable kindness added,\n\n“You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really\nout of luck; you are very much out of luck!”\n\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\nregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was\nodious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\nheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball",
        "taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\ncharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\nill-health.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\nonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\ndeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\nFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than",
        "ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,\nand quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how\nwere his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his\ncoming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could\nnot admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be\nless disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and\ncheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have",
        "faults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat\ndrawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress\nand close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and\ninventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary\ndeclaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection\nwas always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming\nwas to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became",
        "sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in\nlove; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to\nquit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must\nproduce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.\n\n“I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,” said\nshe.—“In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\nthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not",
        "really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\nnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love.\nI should be sorry to be more.”\n\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his\nfeelings.\n\n“_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much\nin love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I\nmust be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable",
        "to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I imagine he\ncan think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had believed\nme at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched.\nCould he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at\nparting would have been different.—Still, however, I must be on my\nguard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it\nnow is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him",
        "to be quite the sort of man—I do not altogether build upon his\nsteadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them\nrather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes\nme thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do\nvery well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good thing\nover; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I\nshall have been let off easily.”",
        "When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\nshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at\nfirst shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\nundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and\ndescribing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed",
        "attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much\nmore might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.—The\ncharm of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more",
        "than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either\na compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and\nin the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by\nany such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\nwords—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss",
        "Woodhouse’s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to\nher.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\n\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material",
        "part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\nto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she\ncould still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without\nher. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew\nmore interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent\nconsolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words\nwhich clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the",
        "idea of Harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. Was it\nimpossible?—No.—Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of\nher face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—For\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\n\n“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.—“I must not think of it. I know",
        "the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\nhappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\nwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\nfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”\n\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet’s behalf, though it\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that\nquarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill’s arrival had succeeded Mr.",
        "Elton’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest\ninterest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank\nChurchill’s disappearance, Mr. Elton’s concerns were assuming the most\nirresistible form.—His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among\nthem again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over\nthe first letter from Enscombe before “Mr. Elton and his bride” was in\nevery body’s mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick",
        "at the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.\nElton; and Harriet’s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been\nlately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston’s ball in view at least, there\nhad been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now\ntoo evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as\ncould stand against the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing, and\nall.\n\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the",
        "reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\ngive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet\nhad a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy\nwork to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever\nagreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet\nlistened submissively, and said “it was very true—it was just as Miss\nWoodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she",
        "would not think about them any longer” but no change of subject could\navail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the\nEltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\n\n“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\nElton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\nYou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It\nwas all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure",
        "you.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you—and it will be a\npainful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\nforgetting it.”\n\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\nexclamation. Emma continued,\n\n“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\nwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than",
        "my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is\nyour duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the\nsuspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your\ntranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.\nThey are very important—and sorry I am that you cannot feel them\nsufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very\nsecondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.",
        "Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what\nwas due—or rather what would be kind by me.”\n\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\nwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\nloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\nof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt\nto what was right and support her in it very tolerably.",
        "“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—Want\ngratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for\nyou!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”\n\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\nmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\nwell, nor valued her affection so highly before.\n\n“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards",
        "to herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and\ntenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all\nthe clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.\nIt is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\nbeloved—which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not—but I\nknow how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the\ncharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!—I would not change",
        "you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\nbreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a\nhundred such—And for a wife—a sensible man’s wife—it is invaluable. I\nmention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\ninterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\nit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to",
        "settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\nnot pretty at all.\n\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to\nmake her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she\nmade a point of Harriet’s going with her, that the worst of the\nbusiness might be gone through as soon as possible.\n\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\nwhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to",
        "lace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\nwould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\nnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too;\nbut she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The\nvisit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and\noccupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself\nentirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,",
        "beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed, and very\npleasing.”\n\nShe did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not elegance.—\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\nwas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\nbut neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\nthought at least it would turn out so.",
        "As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would not\npermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was\nan awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a\nman had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\nwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\nprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\ndepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.",
        "Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\nmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\nbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\nlittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\ncould be.\n\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the house,\nand after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?—Is not she",
        "very charming?”\n\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma’s answer.\n\n“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”\n\n“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”\n\n“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”\n\n“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”\n\n“Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune; and\nshe came in his way.”\n\n“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very\nmuch attached to him.”",
        "“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the woman\nwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought\nthis the best offer she was likely to have.”\n\n“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody could ever\nhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\nWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\nsuperior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different",
        "thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit\nand admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not\nthrown himself away, is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young\nwoman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her ‘Augusta.’\nHow delightful!”\n\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\nmore and judge better. From Harriet’s happening not to be at Hartfield,",
        "and her father’s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\nof an hour of the lady’s conversation to herself, and could composedly\nattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs.\nElton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\nthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be\nvery superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school,\npert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of",
        "people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant,\nand that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\n\nHarriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\nmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\nher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\nalliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.",
        "The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother\nMr. Suckling’s seat;”—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\ngrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\nmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by\nthe size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\nimagine. “Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the\nlikeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at",
        "Maple Grove; her sister’s favourite room.”—Mr. Elton was appealed\nto.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy\nherself at Maple Grove.”\n\n“And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\nstaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\ncould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\ndelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial",
        "to as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a\nlittle sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body\nwho sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a\nhome. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\nunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\nwhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils\nof matrimony.”",
        "Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\n\n“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—the\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\nThe laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\nvery much in the same way—just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of\na fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in",
        "mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\nwho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\nin the same style.”\n\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\npeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\nextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to\nattack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,",
        "“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\nyou have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”\n\n“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.”\n\n“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\ncounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\nSurry.”\n\n“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. “I\nnever heard any county but Surry called so.”",
        "Emma was silenced.\n\n“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or\nsummer at farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time\nfor exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I\ndare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds\nfour perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_\ncarriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely",
        "well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season\nof the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly\nrecommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much\npreferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you\nknow, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as\npossible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored\nto King’s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,",
        "just after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many\nparties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”\n\n“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and\nwe are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at\nhome than engage in schemes of pleasure.”\n\n“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can",
        "be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at\nMaple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to\nBristol, ‘I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I\nabsolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the\nbarouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her\nown good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.’ Many a time\nhas she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I",
        "think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from\nsociety, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to\nmix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too\nmuch or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,\nMiss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father’s state of\nhealth must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he\nshould. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of",
        "its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.”\n\n“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\ndoes not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”\n\n“Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\nwaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,",
        "that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits,\nwhich, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\nrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\non them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\nunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\nso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\nsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of",
        "acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\nalways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\nattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\nwith.”\n\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of\nher being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\n_introduction_—of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\nof Mrs. Elton’s—probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help",
        "of a boarder, just made a shift to live!—The dignity of Miss Woodhouse,\nof Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\n\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\nhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to\nBath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced\nthat the place might suit her better than her father.” And then, to\nprevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.",
        "“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these\noccasions, a lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has\nlong known that you are a superior performer.”\n\n“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\nperformer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a\nquarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\nmusic—passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of",
        "taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\n_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life\nto me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I",
        "honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,\nand expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had\nbeen accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n_world_ I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was",
        "not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who\nhad no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me\nquite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used\nto, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal\nto any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed\nto every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages\nwere not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.",
        "‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without\nsomething of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but\nwithout music, life would be a blank to me.’”\n\n“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\nI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\npardoned, in consideration of the motive.”",
        "“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\nfind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\nconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\nmusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\nWill not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\nnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\nparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in",
        "practice; for married women, you know—there is a sad story against\nthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.”\n\n“But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger,\nsurely?”\n\n“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my\nacquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never\ntouches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may be\nsaid of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two",
        "Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can\nenumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to\nbe quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a\nmarried woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was\nhalf an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.”\n\n“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in so regular\na train—”\n\n“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”",
        "Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\nmore to say; and, after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\nsubject.\n\n“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them both at\nhome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite\nwith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good—there is\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one",
        "directly. She was your governess, I think?”\n\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\nwaited for the affirmative before she went on.\n\n“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”\n\n“Mrs. Weston’s manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good.\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\nmodel for any young woman.”",
        "“And who do you think came in while we were there?”\n\nEmma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance—and\nhow could she possibly guess?\n\n“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley himself!—Was not it\nlucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\nseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.’s,\nI had a great curiosity. ‘My friend Knightley’ had been so often\nmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my",
        "cara sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his\nfriend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.\nDecidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.”\n\nHappily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\nbreathe.\n\n“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse than I had\nsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!—I could not have believed\nit. Knightley!—never seen him in her life before, and call him",
        "Knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\nvulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\nresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\nActually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\nhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\nnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\nform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.",
        "Weston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\ngentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\nmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\nChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\nwould be! Ah! there I am—thinking of him directly. Always the first\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\nas regularly into my mind!”—",
        "All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her\nfather had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons’ departure,\nand was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\n\n“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw her\nbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I",
        "am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\npoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\nyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\nhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\nhaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion;\nI said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought\nto have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it",
        "shews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into\nVicarage Lane.”\n\n“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.”\n\n“Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects to her\nif possible. It was being very deficient.”\n\n“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\nbe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you",
        "make so much of them.”\n\n“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially,\nis never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\nknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\nthey may.”\n\n“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\nsuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”",
        "“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common\npoliteness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\nencouragement to people to marry.”\n\nEmma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\n_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton’s offences, and long, very long,\ndid they occupy her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\nopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as",
        "Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\nwhenever they met again,—self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\nand ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but\nso little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\nknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\nand conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\nElton’s consequence only could surpass.",
        "There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\nfrom his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had\nthe air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to\nHighbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part\nof her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of\njudging, following the lead of Miss Bates’s good-will, or taking it for\ngranted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she",
        "professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton’s\npraise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by\nMiss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked\nwith a good grace of her being “very pleasant and very elegantly\ndressed.”\n\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\nfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.—Offended, probably, by the\nlittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew",
        "back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\nthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\nnecessarily increasing Emma’s dislike. Her manners, too—and Mr.\nElton’s, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\nnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet’s cure; but the\nsensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\nmuch.—It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet’s attachment had been",
        "an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,\nunder a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to\nhim, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the\nobject of their joint dislike.—When they had nothing else to say, it\nmust be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity\nwhich they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader\nvent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.",
        "Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\nmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\nrecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\nwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration—but without\nsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\nbefriend her.—Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\nthird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton’s knight-errantry",
        "on the subject.—\n\n“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave\nabout Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\nladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\nwell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\nis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth—but, upon my word,\nI talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated",
        "to affect one!—Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to\ndo something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\nmust not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those\ncharming lines of the poet,\n\n‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\n    ‘And waste its fragrance on the desert air.’\n\n\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”\n\n“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma’s calm answer—“and",
        "when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax’s situation and\nunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\nhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.”\n\n“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\nobscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\nwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\nI am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she",
        "feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must\nconfess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\ntimidity—and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those\nwho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\nyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\nthan I can express.”\n\n“You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any of",
        "Miss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her\nlonger than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”—\n\n“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the",
        "least inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\nsend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\nthan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not",
        "at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her\nshortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my",
        "brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of\neither but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”\n\n“Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought Emma.—“You have not deserved this. You may",
        "have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\nbeyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs.\nElton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.’ Heavens! Let me not suppose\nthat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!—But upon my honour,\nthere seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s tongue!”\n\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively\naddressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss",
        "Woodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton’s side soon afterwards appeared,\nand she was left in peace—neither forced to be the very particular\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton’s guidance, the very active\npatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\nway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\n\nShe looked on with some amusement.—Miss Bates’s gratitude for Mrs.\nElton’s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless",
        "simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies—the most\namiable, affable, delightful woman—just as accomplished and\ncondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma’s only\nsurprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and\ntolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with\nthe Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!\nThis was astonishing!—She could not have believed it possible that the",
        "taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and\nfriendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\n\n“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.—“To chuse to remain here\nmonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\nmortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her\nconversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have\nalways loved her with such real, generous affection.”",
        "Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\npromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\ninvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\nBates—it all came from her—Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\nWould Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\ncontrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\ndeclined it!",
        "“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\nthis invitation,” was Emma’s conclusion. “She must be under some sort\nof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is\ngreat fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—She is _not_ to\nbe with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must\nshe consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle.”\n\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before",
        "the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\napology for Jane.\n\n“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my\ndear Emma—but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\ngood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\nmust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\nwhat she goes to.”\n\n“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “Miss Fairfax",
        "is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\nher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions\nfrom Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”\n\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\nwas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\nreplied,\n\n“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton’s, I should have imagined, would rather",
        "disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton’s invitations I should\nhave imagined any thing but inviting.”\n\n“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax were to have\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s eagerness in\naccepting Mrs. Elton’s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very\nlikely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in",
        "spite of the very natural wish of a little change.”\n\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\nminutes silence, he said,\n\n“Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton does not\ntalk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\namongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\ncivility in our personal intercourse with each other—a something more",
        "early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\nmay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\nAnd besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\nsure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\nand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\nrespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\nnever fell in Mrs. Elton’s way before—and no degree of vanity can",
        "prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\nnot in consciousness.”\n\n“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little Henry\nwas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\nirresolute what else to say.\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of her.”\n\n“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\nstopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at once—she hurried",
        "on—“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\nis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\nother.”\n\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\nsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\n\n“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\na hint of it six weeks ago.”",
        "He stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on—\n\n“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\nsay, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure I shall\nnever ask her.”\n\nEmma returned her friend’s pressure with interest; and was pleased\nenough to exclaim,\n\n“You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.”\n\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which",
        "shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\n\n“So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?”\n\n“No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just\nnow, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without\nany idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the\nsmallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You",
        "would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were\nmarried.”\n\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\nme by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\nyou.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\nwoman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\nnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”",
        "Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,” said\nshe, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”\n\n“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\nhe asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\nwittier than his neighbours.”\n\n“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles—what",
        "she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\nin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley—what can she do for Mr.\nCole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her\ncivilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\nweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\nof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\nMiss Fairfax’s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton’s",
        "acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\nbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\nI cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”",
        "“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley—“I do not accuse her of\nwant of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong—and her\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\nshe used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded to my\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no",
        "thought beyond.”\n\n“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do\nyou say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax?”\n\n“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\nidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\nwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\ndisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and",
        "evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\nin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\nnever to have a disengaged day.\n\n“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead among you.\nUpon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\nformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a",
        "disengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\nbeen at a loss.”\n\nNo invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\ndinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\nthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\ncard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a",
        "good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon\nshew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the\nspring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in\nwhich her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\nunbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the\nevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\nrefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.",
        "Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\nHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\nshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\nresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\nten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\nusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\nwith the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.",
        "The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons,\nit must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\ncourse—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\nbe asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was not given with\nequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\nby Harriet’s begging to be allowed to decline it. “She would rather not\nbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able",
        "to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\nuncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\nrather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\nfortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to\ngive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.—",
        "Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was\nmore conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\nbeen.—Mr. Knightley’s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\n\n“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which\nwas all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the same age—and\nalways knowing her—I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never",
        "like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her greater\nattention than I have done.”\n\nEvery invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\nhappy.—The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\nweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and",
        "staying one whole day at Hartfield—which one day would be the very day\nof this party.—His professional engagements did not allow of his being\nput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\nso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\nutmost that his nerves could bear—and here would be a ninth—and Emma\napprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\nbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without",
        "falling in with a dinner-party.\n\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\nrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he\nalways said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\nimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\nhave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\ninstead of his brother.\n\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John",
        "Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\nmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\nevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\nand the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\nphilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\nchief of even Emma’s vexation.\n\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John",
        "Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\nagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\nwaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as\nelegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\nsilence—wanting only to observe enough for Isabella’s information—but\nMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\ntalk to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a",
        "walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It\nwas natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\n\n“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\nsure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\nturned directly.”\n\n“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home before\nthe rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters",
        "when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A\nwalk before breakfast does me good.”\n\n“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”\n\n“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”\n\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\n\n“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\nyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and\nHenry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.",
        "The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you\nhave lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth\ngoing through the rain for.”\n\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\n\n“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\nolder should make me indifferent about letters.”\n\n“Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become indifferent.",
        "Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\npositive curse.”\n\n“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\nfriendship.”\n\n“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he coolly.\n“Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.”\n\n“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well—I am\nvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I",
        "can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\nto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes\nthe difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body\ndearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and\ntherefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I\nthink, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\nto-day.”\n\n“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of",
        "years,” said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of situation\nwhich time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time\nwill generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the\ndaily circle—but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an\nold friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years\nhence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”\n\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank",
        "you” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\nnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on\nsuch occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his\nparticular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her—and with all\nhis mildest urbanity, said,\n\n“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning",
        "in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies\nare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\ncomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\nsolicitude about me.”\n\n“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I\nhope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\nold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You",
        "do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are\nboth highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\nsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.”\n\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\nhad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\n\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.\n\n“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in the",
        "rain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you do\nsuch a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”\n\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\n\n“Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\nhow to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\ndid you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\nauthority.”\n\n“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I certainly do",
        "feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.—Liable\nas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\ncareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\nrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\nhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your\ncough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are\nmuch too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing\nagain.”",
        "“Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,” eagerly rejoined Mrs.\nElton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and nodding\nsignificantly—“there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\nI shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\n(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\nbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and\nfrom _us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to",
        "accept such an accommodation.”\n\n“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my early\nwalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\nscarcely ever had a bad morning before.”\n\n“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\nwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,",
        "you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\nmyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\nmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\nsettled.”\n\n“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to\nsuch an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the\nerrand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is\nwhen I am not here, by my grandmama’s.”",
        "“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to\nemploy our men.”\n\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\nanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\n\n“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.—“The\nregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\nand all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”\n\n“It is certainly very well regulated.”",
        "“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a\nletter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\nkingdom, is even carried wrong—and not one in a million, I suppose,\nactually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\nhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.”\n\n“The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness\nof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther",
        "explanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it. That is the\nkey to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\nwell.”\n\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\nobservations made.\n\n“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the same sort of\nhandwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine",
        "the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have\nvery little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand\nthey can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I\nhave not always known their writing apart.”\n\n“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I know what\nyou mean—but Emma’s hand is the strongest.”\n\n“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse; “and",
        "always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with half a sigh and half a\nsmile at her.\n\n“I never saw any gentleman’s handwriting”—Emma began, looking also at\nMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\nto some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect, “Now, how am I\ngoing to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\nbefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout",
        "phrase?—Your Yorkshire friend—your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that\nwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.—No, I can pronounce\nhis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\nbetter.—Now for it.”\n\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—“Mr. Frank Churchill\nwrites one of the best gentleman’s hands I ever saw.”\n\n“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too small—wants\nstrength. It is like a woman’s writing.”",
        "This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\nthe base aspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a\nlarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston\nany letter about her to produce?” No, she had heard from him very\nlately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.\n\n“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my writing-desk, I\nam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.—Do not you",
        "remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?”\n\n“He chose to say he was employed”—\n\n“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\nMr. Knightley.”\n\n“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,” said Mr.\nKnightley dryly, “writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will,\nof course, put forth his best.”\n\nDinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be",
        "allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying—\n\n“Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.”\n\nJane’s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\nthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\n_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in\nfull expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had",
        "not been in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness\nthan usual—a glow both of complexion and spirits.\n\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\nexpense of the Irish mails;—it was at her tongue’s end—but she\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should\nhurt Jane Fairfax’s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of\nthe room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming\nto the beauty and grace of each.",
        "CHAPTER XVII\n\n\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with\nso much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\nJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be\nalmost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\nleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon",
        "began again; and though much that passed between them was in a\nhalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton’s side, there was no avoiding a\nknowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office—catching\ncold—fetching letters—and friendship, were long under discussion; and\nto them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to\nJane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\nsuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton’s meditated activity.",
        "“Here is April come!” said she, “I get quite anxious about you. June\nwill soon be here.”\n\n“But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked\nforward to the summer in general.”\n\n“But have you really heard of nothing?”\n\n“I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.”\n\n“Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.”\n\n“I not aware!” said Jane, shaking her head; “dear Mrs. Elton, who can",
        "have thought of it as I have done?”\n\n“But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\nhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\na vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\nMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\nbody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first\ncircle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable!",
        "Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge’s is the one I would most wish\nto see you in.”\n\n“Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,” said\nJane. “I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\nit;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.”\n\n“Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me",
        "trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\nmore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\na day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\nfor any thing eligible.”\n\n“Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;\ntill the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\ntrouble.”\n\n“But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,",
        "or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\nus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you\ndeserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday\noccurrence, is not obtained at a moment’s notice; indeed, indeed, we\nmust begin inquiring directly.”\n\n“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.",
        "When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of\nbeing long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\nwould soon produce something—Offices for the sale—not quite of human\nflesh—but of human intellect.”\n\n“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\nthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend\nto the abolition.”\n\n“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane;",
        "“governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\nthe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I\nonly mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\napplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\nsomething that would do.”\n\n“Something that would do!” repeated Mrs. Elton. “Aye, _that_ may suit",
        "your humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are;\nbut it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\nthing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\nlife.”\n\n“You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it\nwould be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\nthink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.",
        "A gentleman’s family is all that I should condition for.”\n\n“I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\nbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\non my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\nfirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\nyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\nas much as you chose;—that is—I do not know—if you knew the harp, you",
        "might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;—yes, I\nreally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you\nchose;—and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\ncomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.”\n\n“You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a\nsituation together,” said Jane, “they are pretty sure to be equal;\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at",
        "present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\nobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\nnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\nshall remain where I am, and as I am.”\n\n“And I am quite serious too, I assure you,” replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\n“in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\nwatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.”",
        "In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till\nMr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of\nobject, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\n\n“Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of his\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he\nis;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;",
        "modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\nyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\nbegan to think my cara sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am\nrather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\nit?—Selina’s choice—handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is\nnot over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\nover-trimmed—quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments",
        "now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\na bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of\ndress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\nminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show\nand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\ntrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\nlook well?”\n\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.",
        "Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late\ndinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too\nmuch expected by the best judges, for surprize—but there was great joy.\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been\nsorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute\nastonishment.—That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at\nhome after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk",
        "half a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being in mixed\ncompany till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility\nand the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A\nman who had been in motion since eight o’clock in the morning, and\nmight now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have\nbeen silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been\nalone!—Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own",
        "fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again\ninto the world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\nback his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley looked\nat him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, “I could\nnot have believed it even of _him_.”\n\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was",
        "exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\nmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\ninquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\nher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\nabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\ncommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he",
        "had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\nthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\nhad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\n\n“Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few\nlines—will not take you long; read it to Emma.”\n\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\nto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible\nto every body.",
        "“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\nto it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?—Anne,\nmy dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?—In\ntown next week, you see—at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\nimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\nlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us",
        "again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\nand he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\nWell, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\nit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\nother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\ncircumstance to the others in a common way.”\n\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and",
        "words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\nhappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm\nand open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little\noccupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the\ndegree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\n\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,",
        "and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\n\nIt was well that he took every body’s joy for granted, or he might not\nhave thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\ndelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\nbe made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\nshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have",
        "been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\nElton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the\nsubject with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n“I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,”\nsaid Mr. Weston.\n\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\nher by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\n\n“You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,” he",
        "continued—“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.”\n\n“Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.”\n\n“You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.— He\nis to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\nletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my",
        "son’s hand, presumed to open it—though it was not directed to me—it was\nto Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\nhardly ever get a letter.”\n\n“And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\nWeston—(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most\ndangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours\nfollow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we",
        "married women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\nnot have believed it of you!”\n\n“Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\nElton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry,\nmerely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to\ntown directly, on Mrs. Churchill’s account—she has not been well the\nwhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to\nmove southward without loss of time.”",
        "“Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?”\n\n“Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\nconsiderable journey.”\n\n“Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\nfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\nof large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\nSuckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me—but twice\nin one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four",
        "horses.”\n\n“The evil of the distance from Enscombe,” said Mr. Weston, “is, that\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\nsofa for a week together. In Frank’s last letter she complained, he\nsaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\nboth his arm and his uncle’s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\nweakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\nsleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word. Certainly,",
        "delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\nmust grant me that.”\n\n“No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\nown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a formidable\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—and I assure you,\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\nwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill’s making incredible exertions to",
        "avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her—and I believe I have\ncaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\nan excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?”\n\n“Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\nlady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the\nland for”—\n\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\n\n“Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\nyou. Do not run away with such an idea.”",
        "“Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\na fine lady as any body ever beheld.”\n\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\n_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\nit;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\nWeston went on.\n\n“Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but",
        "this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\ntherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\nnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I\nwould not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith\nin Mrs. Churchill’s illness.”\n\n“If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath, or to\nClifton?” “She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for",
        "her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\nbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\nretired.”\n\n“Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\nthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\nseem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—And",
        "Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\nthat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough\nin herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman\ncannot have too many resources—and I feel very thankful that I have so\nmany myself as to be quite independent of society.”\n\n“Frank was here in February for a fortnight.”\n\n“So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society",
        "of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\nsuch a creature in the world.”\n\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\nWeston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\n\n“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing\npossible. Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston’s letters lately have\nbeen full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.”",
        "He had done his duty and could return to his son.\n\n“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we\nmight see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome. It has\nbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\nhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\nup—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\ndesponding. ‘How could he contrive to come? And how could it be",
        "supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—I\nalways felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has,\nyou see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if\nthings are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”\n\n“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say\nto a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,\nbecause things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the",
        "rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and\nexclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen’s\nsaffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to\ndispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The\ncarriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning, I\nremember, he came to me quite in despair.”\n\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\nseized the opportunity of going on.",
        "“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is\nordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\nEnscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring—precisely the\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\nthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\nnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best",
        "of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there\nalways is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the",
        "state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\ngratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.”\n\n“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.",
        "Frank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\nof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means\nimplicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,\nso I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer.”\n\nMr. Weston was musing.\n\n“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\nChurchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me",
        "to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be\nignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the\ntreatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of\nit is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank’s mother would\nnever have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has\npride; but his pride is nothing to his wife’s: his is a quiet,\nindolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only",
        "make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance\nand insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair\npretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely\nthe daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a\nChurchill she has out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims:\nbut in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.”\n\n“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a",
        "horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\npeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\nare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\nthemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\ndirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\nencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense\nairs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established",
        "families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived\nat West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came\nfrom Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.\nWeston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is\nsomething direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of\nthe Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\nyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my",
        "brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\nneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\nyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him—I\nbelieve, at least—I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\nthe purchase before his death.”\n\nThey were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\nsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.",
        "After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\nWoodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\nnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of\nspirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\n\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to",
        "leave them early the next day; and he soon began with—\n\n“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\nboys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at\nfull length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise\nthan her’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have\nto recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\nthem.”\n\n“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall do all in",
        "my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”\n\n“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”\n\n“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”\n\n“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even\nmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue\nto increase as much as they have done lately.”\n\n“Increase!”",
        "“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\ngreat difference in your way of life.”\n\n“Difference! No indeed I am not.”\n\n“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\nthan you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for\nonly one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—When did it\nhappen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,\nand you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella",
        "brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole’s, or balls\nat the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in\nyour goings-on, is very great.”\n\n“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it all.”\n\n“Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\nthat Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I\nonly beg you to send them home.”",
        "“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence. Let them\nbe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”\n\n“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like to know\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\nof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\nto attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine—what\nhave they been? Dining once with the Coles—and having a ball talked of,",
        "which never took place. I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John\nKnightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning\nto Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours\nfrom Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for\nme, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that\nif Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much",
        "better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours\nwhere she is absent one—and who, when he is at home, is either reading\nto himself or settling his accounts.”\n\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton’s beginning to talk to him.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME III\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She",
        "was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\napprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\nreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but\nif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\ntwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he\nhad taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\nmonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before",
        "her:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did not\nmean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\n\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\nacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\ndecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a",
        "crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and\ntranquil state.\n\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had\nforeseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank\nChurchill’s feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so\nsoon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.\nHe rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he\ncame from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise",
        "all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was\ninfluenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost\nfriendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing\nher. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\nhad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. She\nwatched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had\nbeen. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had",
        "produced this very natural and very desirable effect.\n\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and\nhe was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\nhis comparative indifference. He was not calm; his spirits were\nevidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he\nwas, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what",
        "decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an\nhour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. “He had seen a\ngroup of old acquaintance in the street as he passed—he had not\nstopped, he would not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity\nto think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he\nwished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.” She had no\ndoubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits,",
        "nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather\ninclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a\ndiscreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.\n\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\nHe was often hoping, intending to come—but was always prevented. His\naunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\nRandall’s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was",
        "to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill’s removal to London had been of no\nservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\nreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,\nat Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he\nlooked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been\nhalf a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that\ncare and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have",
        "many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,\nby all his father’s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely\nimaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.\n\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not\nendure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\nsuffering; and by the ten days’ end, her nephew’s letter to Randalls\ncommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to",
        "Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\nan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\nready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\nexpected from the change.\n\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\nbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the",
        "house was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\nthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\ncould even wish.\n\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\nhoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\n\nMr. Weston’s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It\nwas the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be",
        "really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a\nyoung man?—An hour’s ride. He would be always coming over. The\ndifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\nthe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\nmiles—nay, eighteen—it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street—was a\nserious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent\nin coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London;",
        "he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for\neasy intercourse. Better than nearer!\n\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\nremoval,—the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but\nit had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\nhowever, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\nvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines",
        "from Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the\nchange, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for\ntwenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a\nday as possible.\n\nMr. Weston’s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\n\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to",
        "spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have\nany thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\nChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\nbefore dinner, and every thing was safe.",
        "No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at\nthe Crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common\nmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort\nof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse\nhim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man’s",
        "company. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good\ntime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\n\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it\nshould be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of\nanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,",
        "without great surprize. “So unreasonably early!” she was going to\nexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,\nwho were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.\nWeston’s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another\ncarriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same\ndistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if\nhalf the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of",
        "preparatory inspection.\n\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.\nWeston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a\nman who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\ndistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a\nlittle less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\ncharacter.—General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man",
        "what he ought to be.—She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked\nabout, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to\ndo, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a\nfire in the evening was still very pleasant.\n\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston’s fault that the number of privy\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates’s door",
        "to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\nbrought by the Eltons.\n\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\nthe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,—impatient\nto begin, or afraid of being always near her.\n\nMrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he. “I\nhave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.",
        "It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.”\n\nA carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\nsaid,\n\n“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\npassed.\n\n“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about. “We\nthought you were to bring them.”",
        "The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\nlonged to know what Frank’s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\nby giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\n\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of rain.—“I\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank to his father:",
        "“Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. Weston was\nfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\nof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\nthough by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\n\n“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\nI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\npleased with him.—You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a",
        "very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\napprove—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them.\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me\nhad ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\nmuch better.”",
        "While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston’s attention was chained; but\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\n\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\nextremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a\npleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you",
        "were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite\nunnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.”\n\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\nthe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\nWeston’s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be\nunderstood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every\nbody’s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,",
        "who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes\nafter her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door\nopened she was heard,\n\n“So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\ncare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—Well!—(as soon as\nshe was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!—This is\nadmirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could",
        "not have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane, Jane, look!—did you\never see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin’s\nlamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\nI came in; she was standing in the entrance. ‘Oh! Mrs. Stokes,’ said\nI—but I had not time for more.” She was now met by Mrs. Weston.—“Very\nwell, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\nit. So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often,",
        "and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it\nindeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the\ncarriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the\nhorses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our\nthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most\nkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in\none day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my",
        "word, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.\nWoodhouse’s. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings are not\nwarm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon’s wedding-present.—So kind of her\nto think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know—Mr. Dixon’s choice.\nThere were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some\ntime. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you\nsure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so",
        "afraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to\nstep upon—I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother’s spectacles have never been in\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\nyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\nChurchill?—Ah! here’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you\ndo?—Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in",
        "fairy-land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing\nEmma most complacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss\nWoodhouse, you do look—how do you like Jane’s hair?—You are a\njudge.—She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\nhair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I\ndeclare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\nmoment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This is",
        "delightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there he is. Don’t\ndisturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do\nyou do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the\ntown—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss\nCaroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do\nyou do? How do you all do?—Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never\nbetter.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the",
        "worthy Coles.—Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among\nsuch friends! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I\nthank you, for me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir,\nby and bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!”\n\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\ndiscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little",
        "way behind her.—He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she\ncould not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress\nand look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was\nevidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was, “How do you\nlike my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my\nhair?”—with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\npoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, “Nobody can think less of dress in",
        "general than I do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s\neyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons—who I have\nno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—I would not wish\nto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\nmine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.—We shall\nsee if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\nI like him very well.”",
        "At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\nbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\nmore;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\nanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton’s tones again distinctly\nforward.—Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\n\n“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—I was\nthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\ntidings of us.”",
        "“Jane!”—repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\ndispleasure.—“That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.\n\n“Not at all.”\n\n“You are ungrateful.”\n\n“Ungrateful!—What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to a\nsmile—“No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is\nmy father?—When are we to begin dancing?”\n\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked",
        "off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\nMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\nlaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\nmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\ninterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.—Emma\nheard the sad truth with fortitude.\n\n“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr. Weston.\n“She will think Frank ought to ask her.”",
        "Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\nboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\nperfect approbation of—and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\nwanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\nwas to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.—Mr.\nWeston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\nWoodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,",
        "though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was\nalmost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly\nthe advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though\nshe had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by\nthe change. Mr. Weston might be his son’s superior.—In spite of this\nlittle rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see\nthe respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that",
        "she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.—She was more\ndisturbed by Mr. Knightley’s not dancing than by any thing else.—There\nhe was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be\ndancing,—not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and\nwhist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance\ntill their rubbers were made up,—so young as he looked!—He could not\nhave appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had",
        "placed himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms\nand stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must\ndraw every body’s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not\none among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—He\nmoved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in\nhow gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have\ndanced, would he but take the trouble.—Whenever she caught his eye, she",
        "forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he\ncould love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.—He\nseemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he\nthought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she\ndid not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and\nher partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.\nThat Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was\nindubitable.",
        "The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings\nusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something",
        "of.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\npartner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been\nhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one\ndisengaged was the wonder!—But Emma’s wonder lessened soon afterwards,\non seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance\nif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she\nwas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.",
        "Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room\nwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in\nfront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of\nmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss\nSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.—Emma saw it. She was\nnot yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had\ntherefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little",
        "she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were\nexactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;\nbut Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue\nwhich just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she\nperceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was\nnot only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant\nglances.—The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join",
        "him and say, “Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply\nwas, “Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”\n\n“Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\ndancer.”\n\n“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great\npleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\nmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\ngreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\nGilbert.”",
        "“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.” “Miss\nSmith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—and if I were\nnot an old married man.—But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You\nwill excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\ncommand—but my dancing days are over.”\n\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and",
        "mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton!\nthe amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.—She looked round for a moment;\nhe had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging\nhimself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed\nbetween him and his wife.\n\nShe would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\nface might be as hot.\n\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr. Knightley leading",
        "Harriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\nboth for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\ntoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\ncatch his eye again.\n\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\nand Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for",
        "the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\nand very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\nannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\nflew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\n\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\ngrowing very like her;—_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing",
        "audibly to her partner,\n\n“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good-natured,\nI declare.”\n\nSupper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard\nfrom that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table\nand taking up her spoon.\n\n“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet. Mrs.\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there\nwill be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—One",
        "door nailed up—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr.\nChurchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!—so\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody\nmissed me.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits",
        "and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of\nher throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\namused, and who were your partners. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not\nforestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love\nto tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.\nElton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’\nMy dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not",
        "rather?—I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane\non one arm, and me on the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little\nback, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she\nlooks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen\nof the evening!—Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take\ncare of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded\nthere were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there",
        "is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and\nstyle—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,\nJane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits,\nexcellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of\nsweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.\nWoodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all\nout again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread",
        "and asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would\nnot speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss\nWoodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is\nbrilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!—Such\nelegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since—Well, where\nshall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a\ndraught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this",
        "side?—Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill—only it seems too good—but just as\nyou please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane,\nhow shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too!\nBless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent,\nand I cannot help beginning.”\n\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\nbut, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him",
        "irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\nreprobation of Mr. Elton’s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\nand Mrs. Elton’s looks also received the due share of censure.\n\n“They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,” said he. “Emma, why is it\nthat they are your enemies?”\n\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\n“_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may",
        "be.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\nthat you did want him to marry Harriet.”\n\n“I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.”\n\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\nonly said,\n\n“I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.”\n\n“Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell\nme I am wrong?”\n\n“Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong,",
        "I am sure the other tells you of it.”\n\n“I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There\nis a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not:\nand I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was\nthrough a series of strange blunders!”\n\n“And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\njustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\nchosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which",
        "Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\ngirl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\nwoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.”\n\nEmma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the bustle of\nMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\n\n“Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\ndoing?—Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!",
        "Every body is asleep!”\n\n“I am ready,” said Emma, “whenever I am wanted.”\n\n“Whom are you going to dance with?” asked Mr. Knightley.\n\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, “With you, if you will ask\nme.”\n\n“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.\n\n“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.”\n\n“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III",
        "This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\npleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\nshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.—She was extremely\nglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\nEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\nalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\npeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few",
        "minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\noccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\nto another happy result—the cure of Harriet’s infatuation.—From\nHarriet’s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted\nthe ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were\nsuddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the\nsuperior creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma",
        "could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by\ninjurious courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\nsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\nrequisite.—Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\nMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\nmust be before her!\n\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that",
        "he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he\nwas to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\n\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them\nall to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened\nup for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their\ngrandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons\nentered whom she had never less expected to see together—Frank",
        "Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm—actually Harriet!—A moment\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\nHarriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer\nher.—The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards\nasunder;—they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately\nsinking into a chair fainted away.\n\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,",
        "and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\nsuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\nwith the whole.\n\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\nGoddard’s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\nfor safety, had led them into alarm.—About half a mile beyond Highbury,",
        "making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\nfor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had\nadvanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\ndistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\nparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\nMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and\ncalling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight",
        "hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to\nHighbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much\nfrom cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in\nthis state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\n\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\ncourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could",
        "not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen\nchildren, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and\nimpertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.—More and more\nfrightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her\npurse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to\nuse her ill.—She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was\nmoving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was",
        "followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\n\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\nconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\na mile or two beyond Highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of",
        "scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on\nfoot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength",
        "enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It\nwas his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\nplace.\n\nThis was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and of\nHarriet’s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—He dared\nnot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not\nanother minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\nsafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people",
        "in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the\ngrateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\n\nSuch an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\nideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\nleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\nhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and",
        "heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\nat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?—How much\nmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\nforesight!—especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\nmind had already made.\n\nIt was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no",
        "rencontre, no alarm of the kind;—and now it had happened to the very\nperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\nto pass by to rescue her!—It certainly was very extraordinary!—And\nknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\nperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\nattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr.\nElton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most",
        "interesting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence\nshould not be strongly recommending each to the other.\n\nIn the few minutes’ conversation which she had yet had with him, while\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her\nnaïveté, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet’s own\naccount had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the",
        "abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing\nwas to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\nShe would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\ninterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive\nscheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account\nproceed.\n\nEmma’s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\nwhat had passed,—aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but",
        "she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\nit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\nwho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\nthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last\nnight’s ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as\nhe sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without\ntheir promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some",
        "comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse\n(for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well\nas Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\nthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\nindifferent—which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\nan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for",
        "she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\nillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\n\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\nthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\ndwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\nnephews:—in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and",
        "John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\ngipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\nslightest particular from the original recital.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\nmorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\nand hesitating, thus began:\n\n“Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I should",
        "like to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you know, it\nwill be over.”\n\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\nseriousness in Harriet’s manner which prepared her, quite as much as\nher words, for something more than ordinary.\n\n“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued, “to have\nno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\ncreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the",
        "satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\nnecessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\nI dare say you understand me.”\n\n“Yes,” said Emma, “I hope I do.”\n\n“How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...” cried Harriet,\nwarmly. “It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\nin him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not—except that of the\ntwo I had rather not see him—and indeed I would go any distance round",
        "to avoid him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\nher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\nall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall\nnever forget her look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss\nWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together,\nit will not give me another moment’s pang: and to convince you that I\nhave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to",
        "have destroyed long ago—what I ought never to have kept—I know that\nvery well (blushing as she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it\nall—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\nmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\nholds?” said she, with a conscious look.\n\n“Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing?”\n\n“No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\nvery much.”",
        "She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which\nHarriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\nexcepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\n\n“Now,” said Harriet, “you _must_ recollect.”\n\n“No, indeed I do not.”",
        "“Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\ntimes we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my\nsore throat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came—I think the\nvery evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took",
        "mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\ncut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before\nhe gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help\nmaking a treasure of it—so I put it by never to be used, and looked at\nit now and then as a great treat.”\n\n“My dearest Harriet!” cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and\njumping up, “you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.",
        "Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\nrelic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about\nme!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my\npocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual\nblush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on—what\nelse?”\n\n“And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected",
        "it, you did it so naturally.”\n\n“And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!”\nsaid Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, “Lord\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\npiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\nnever was equal to this.”\n\n“Here,” resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, “here is something",
        "still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\nthis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\nnever did.”\n\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of\nan old pencil,—the part without any lead.\n\n“This was really his,” said Harriet.—“Do not you remember one\nmorning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I forget exactly\nthe day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_",
        "_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\nabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\nhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\nit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\ntable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\ndared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.”",
        "“I do remember it,” cried Emma; “I perfectly remember it.—Talking about\nspruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and\nMr. Elton’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly\nremember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I\nhave an idea he was standing just here.”\n\n“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I cannot\nrecollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\nam now.”—\n\n“Well, go on.”",
        "“Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say—except that\nI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to\nsee me do it.”\n\n“My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\ntreasuring up these things?”\n\n“Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\ncould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but",
        "had not resolution enough to part with them.”\n\n“But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I have not a\nword to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\nuseful.”\n\n“I shall be happier to burn it,” replied Harriet. “It has a\ndisagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes,\nand there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.”\n\n“And when,” thought Emma, “will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?”",
        "She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\nalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\n_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet’s.—About a\nfortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and\nquite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which\nmade the information she received more valuable. She merely said, in\nthe course of some trivial chat, “Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I",
        "would advise you to do so and so”—and thought no more of it, till after\na minute’s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, “I\nshall never marry.”\n\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\nmoment’s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not,\nreplied,\n\n“Never marry!—This is a new resolution.”\n\n“It is one that I shall never change, however.”\n\nAfter another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from—I hope",
        "it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?”\n\n“Mr. Elton indeed!” cried Harriet indignantly.—“Oh! no”—and Emma could\njust catch the words, “so superior to Mr. Elton!”\n\nShe then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\nfarther?—should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?—Perhaps\nHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she\nwere totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to",
        "hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had\nbeen, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she\nwas perfectly resolved.—She believed it would be wiser for her to say\nand know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was\nalways best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,\non any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have\nthe judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.—She was",
        "decided, and thus spoke—\n\n“Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\nan idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly\nyour superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?”\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose—\nIndeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\ndistance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of",
        "the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\nproper, in me especially.”\n\n“I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\nwas enough to warm your heart.”\n\n“Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time—when I saw him\ncoming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one\nmoment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!”",
        "“It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.—Yes,\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it\nwill be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\nadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for\nits being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\nwisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\nlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be",
        "observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\ngive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\nthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\nknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were\nvery wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no\ndoubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious\nnature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there",
        "have been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I\nwould not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured\nyour raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I\nshall always know how to value.”\n\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\nvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her\nfriend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must\nbe saving her from the danger of degradation.",
        "CHAPTER V\n\n\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\nEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\nto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\ngrandmother’s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was\nagain delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was\nlikely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she",
        "were able to defeat Mrs. Elton’s activity in her service, and save\nherself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her\nwill.\n\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had\ncertainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing\nto dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in\nhis pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\nEvery thing declared it; his own attentions, his father’s hints, his",
        "mother-in-law’s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,\ndiscretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many\nwere devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,\nMr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with\nJane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of\nintelligence between them—he thought so at least—symptoms of admiration\non his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself",
        "to think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any\nof Emma’s errors of imagination. _She_ was not present when the\nsuspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and\nJane, at the Eltons’; and he had seen a look, more than a single look,\nat Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed\nsomewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not\nhelp remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations",
        "which, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\n\n“Myself creating what I saw,”\n\n\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of\nprivate liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill\nand Jane.\n\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\nhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he\njoined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,",
        "like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\nweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\nand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\nreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\nvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\nand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;\nand after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons",
        "listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse’s\nmost obliging invitation.\n\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on\nhorseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.\n\n“By the bye,” said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, “what\nbecame of Mr. Perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”\n\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, “I did not know that he ever\nhad any such plan.”\n\n“Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.”",
        "“Me! impossible!”\n\n“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was\ncertainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\nextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\nthought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\nmust remember it now?”\n\n“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”\n\n“Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must have",
        "dreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk as if you\nwere tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”\n\n“What is this?—What is this?” cried Mr. Weston, “about Perry and a\ncarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he\ncan afford it. You had it from himself, had you?”\n\n“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it from\nnobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston’s having",
        "mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with\nall these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\nit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I\ndream of every body at Highbury when I am away—and when I have gone\nthrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\nPerry.”\n\n“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should have had such",
        "a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry’s setting up his carriage! and\nhis wife’s persuading him to it, out of care for his health—just what\nwill happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\npremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your\ndream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are",
        "absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?”\n\nEmma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\nprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of\nMr. Weston’s hint.\n\n“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\nto be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I do not mean\nto say that he did not dream it—I am sure I have sometimes the oddest",
        "dreams in the world—but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\nthat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\nmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\nourselves—but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\nthought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\nhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\nbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don’t you remember",
        "grandmama’s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had\nbeen walking to—very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\nRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed I\ndo not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\nbeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\nI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having",
        "never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing\nbefore I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and\nnow and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not\nlike Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the\nleast thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh! just behind. Perfectly\nremember Mrs. Perry’s coming.—Extraordinary dream, indeed!”\n\nThey were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley’s eyes had preceded Miss",
        "Bates’s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill’s face, where he\nthought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\ninvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\nwith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen\nwaited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\nChurchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her\nintently—in vain, however, if it were so—Jane passed between them into",
        "the hall, and looked at neither.\n\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\nborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\nthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\nand which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\npersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on\nwhich two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea",
        "passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\n\n“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\nhim, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away\ntheir alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is\nit? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated\nrather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters\none morning. I want to puzzle you again.”",
        "Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was\nquickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\ndisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\nfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The\nquietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,\nwho had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.\nWeston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in",
        "lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor\nlittle boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter\nnear him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\n\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\nglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\nEmma, Jane opposite to them—and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\nall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little",
        "apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\npushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\nburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\nlooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\nevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell\nto work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\nThe word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there",
        "was a blush on Jane’s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise\nostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could\nall be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion\nof his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must\nbe some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed\nto meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for\ngallantry and trick. It was a child’s play, chosen to conceal a deeper",
        "game on Frank Churchill’s part.\n\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\nand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a\nshort word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and\ndemure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly\nentertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to\nappear to censure; for she said, “Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank",
        "Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, “I will give it to\nher—shall I?”—and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing\nwarmth. “No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.”\n\nIt was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley’s excessive curiosity",
        "to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to\nbe _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her\ncomprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the\nsuperior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not",
        "know that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\nattack, and turned towards her aunt.\n\n“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\na word—“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\ngoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking",
        "for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\nnight.”\n\nJane’s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;\nbut so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.\nKnightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed\ntowards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was\nafterwards looking for her shawl—Frank Churchill was looking also—it",
        "was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,\nMr. Knightley could not tell.\n\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what\nhe had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\nobservations, he must—yes, he certainly must, as a friend—an anxious\nfriend—give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\nhis duty.",
        "“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\npoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw\nthe word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining\nto the one, and so very distressing to the other.”\n\nEmma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she\nwas really ashamed of having ever imparted them.",
        "“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere\njoke among ourselves.”\n\n“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and Mr.\nChurchill.”\n\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\nbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\ndoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference—fruitless\ninterference. Emma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed",
        "to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to\nher, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome\ninterference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather\nthan the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\n\n“My dear Emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you think\nyou perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”",
        "“Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.—Why\ndo you make a doubt of it?”\n\n“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\nthat she admired him?”\n\n“Never, never!” she cried with a most open eagerness—“Never, for the\ntwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\nit possibly come into your head?”\n\n“I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between",
        "them—certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\npublic.”\n\n“Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very sorry\nto check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do. There is no\nadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\nhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings\nrather of a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to",
        "explain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which is\ncapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\nfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\nthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\ncan _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman’s\nindifference.”\n\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which",
        "silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\nprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\nsuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\ncircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\nhers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\nirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\nfever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse’s tender habits required almost",
        "every evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\nleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\nSuckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\nimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\npresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again",
        "restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings’\ncoming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the\nsituation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might\neventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of\nall her neighbours was by the approach of it.\n\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal",
        "of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\nwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\nat first;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\nneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the\nSucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\nautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\nto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the",
        "idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see\nwhat every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had\nagreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be\ndone in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the\nbustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic\nparade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.",
        "This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\nfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.\nWeston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and\nsister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go\ntogether; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it\nwas to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing\nbut her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must",
        "already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:—it\ncould not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain\nto his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an\narrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an\narrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of\nbeing said to be of Mrs. Elton’s party! Every feeling was offended; and\nthe forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of",
        "secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr.\nWeston’s temper.\n\n“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very comfortably.\n“But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\nnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\nleave her out.”\n\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.",
        "It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was\ngrowing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\npigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\ninto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\nbefore the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\non, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton’s resources were\ninadequate to such an attack.",
        "“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she cried.—“And such weather\nfor exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\nare we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.\nBefore this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\nexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”\n\n“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley. “That may\nbe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are\nripening fast.”",
        "If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like\nit of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\nfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\nbut no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\nthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\nand again to come—much oftener than he doubted—and was extremely",
        "gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\nas she chose to consider it.\n\n“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come. Name your\nday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”\n\n“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some others whom\nI would wish to meet you.”\n\n“Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”",
        "“I hope you will bring Elton,” said he: “but I will not trouble you to\ngive any other invitations.”\n\n“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be afraid\nof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party.\nLeave it all to me. I will invite your guests.”\n\n“No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and",
        "that one is—”\n\n“—Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\n\n“No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such\nmatters myself.”\n\n“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one\npreferred to herself.—“You are a humourist, and may say what you like.\nQuite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me—Jane and her\naunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting",
        "the Hartfield family. Don’t scruple. I know you are attached to them.”\n\n“You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on\nMiss Bates in my way home.”\n\n“That’s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you like. It is\nto be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\nshall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\non my arm. Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be",
        "more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\nno form or parade—a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your\ngardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\ntrees;—and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\nof doors—a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\nand simple as possible. Is not that your idea?”\n\n“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the",
        "table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\ngentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\nbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.”\n\n“Well—as you please; only don’t have a great set out. And, by the bye,\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be\nsincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to\ninspect anything—”",
        "“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”\n\n“Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\nclever.”\n\n“I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\nwould spurn any body’s assistance.”\n\n“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by. I\nreally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I",
        "conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so\nmany resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\nhome;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is dust, and in\nwinter there is dirt.”\n\n“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane\nis never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however,\nif you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole’s. I would wish every thing\nto be as much to your taste as possible.”",
        "“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\nwarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.—Yes,\nbelieve me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\nthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\nme.”\n\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\nwished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;",
        "and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat\nwould inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\nspecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\nDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.\n\nHe was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him\nfor his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for\ntwo years. “Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go",
        "very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear\ngirls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp\nnow, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house\nagain exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,\nand any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all\nto his, and Emma’s, and Harriet’s going there some very fine morning.\nHe thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them—very kind",
        "and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining\nout.”\n\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body’s most ready concurrence. The\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\nMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\nto themselves.—Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\npleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over\nto join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which",
        "could have been dispensed with.—Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say\nthat he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no\ntime in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\n\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\nBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\nsettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,—the weather appearing\nexactly right.\n\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was",
        "safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\nthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\nAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\nhappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\nhad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\nto heat themselves.—Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\npurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all",
        "the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\nsympathiser.\n\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\nwas satisfied of her father’s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and\nlook around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more\nparticular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds\nwhich must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\n\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with",
        "the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\nthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered—its ample gardens\nstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\nall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight—and its abundance\nof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\nhad rooted up.—The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike",
        "it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\ncomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.—It was just what it ought\nto be, and it looked what it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\nin blood and understanding.—Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\nbut Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\nneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These",
        "were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\nwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\nstrawberry-beds.—The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\nChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\nin all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was\nvery ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\ntalking—strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or",
        "spoken of.—“The best fruit in England—every body’s favourite—always\nwholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather\nfor one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly\nthe best time—never tired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely\nsuperior—no comparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very\nscarce—Chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price of\nstrawberries in London—abundance about Bristol—Maple",
        "Grove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking exactly\ndifferent—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of their\nway—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to\ncherries—currants more refreshing—only objection to gathering\nstrawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no\nlonger—must go and sit in the shade.”\n\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only once by",
        "Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\ninquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—She had some fears\nof his horse.\n\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to\noverhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.—A situation,\na most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received\nnotice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs.",
        "Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it\nfell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an\nacquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful,\ncharming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every\nthing—and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\nimmediately.—On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph—and she\npositively refused to take her friend’s negative, though Miss Fairfax",
        "continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\nthing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\nbefore.—Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\nacquiescence by the morrow’s post.—How Jane could bear it at all, was\nastonishing to Emma.—She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly—and at\nlast, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\nremoval.—“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the",
        "gardens—all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent.”—The\npertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\n\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a\nscattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of\nlimes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the\nriver, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.—It led to nothing;",
        "nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,\nwhich seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an\napproach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,\nas might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a\ncharming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.—The\nconsiderable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,\ngradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a",
        "mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well\nclothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed\nand sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the\nriver making a close and handsome curve around it.\n\nIt was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without\nbeing oppressive.\n\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and",
        "towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\ndistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\nHarriet!—It was an odd tête-à-tête; but she was glad to see it.—There\nhad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\nturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\nconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been\nsorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;",
        "but now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its\nappendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading\nflocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.—She\njoined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in\nlooking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes of\nagriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, “These\nare my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without",
        "being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.”—She did not suspect him.\nIt was too old a story.—Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of\nHarriet.—They took a few turns together along the walk.—The shade was\nmost refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\n\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\nWeston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself",
        "uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\nthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\ncoming, with more than common certainty. “His aunt was so much better,\nthat he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”—Mrs. Churchill’s\nstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\nsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\ndependence—and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,",
        "that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented\ncoming.—Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\nshe behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\n\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\nwhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as\nfar as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\nany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.—Mr.",
        "Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\nof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by\nhim, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him,\nthat Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise\nand variety which her spirits seemed to need.\n\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse’s\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,",
        "shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\nprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the\nkindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly\nwell amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he\nwould shew them all to Emma;—fortunate in having no other resemblance\nto a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was\nslow, constant, and methodical.—Before this second looking over was",
        "begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few\nmoments’ free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the\nhouse—and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly\nin from the garden, and with a look of escape.—Little expecting to meet\nMiss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse\nwas the very person she was in quest of.\n\n“Will you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say that I am",
        "gone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is,\nnor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we shall be wanted, and\nI am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any\nbody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to\nthe ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not\nbe missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I\nam gone?”",
        "“Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury\nalone?”\n\n“Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\nminutes.”\n\n“But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\nfather’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can be\nround in five minutes.”\n\n“Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for\n_me_ to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may so soon have to guard\nothers!”",
        "She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, “That\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already.”\n\n“I am,”—she answered—“I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\nfatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse, we all know at\ntimes what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\nexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me",
        "have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.”\n\nEmma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\nher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched\nher safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\ngrateful—and her parting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\nbeing sometimes alone!”—seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\nto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,",
        "even towards some of those who loved her best.\n\n“Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said Emma, as she turned back into\nthe hall again. “I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\ntheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.”\n\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\naccomplished some views of St. Mark’s Place, Venice, when Frank\nChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had",
        "forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\nwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right who\nhad named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by a\ntemporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\nlasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\ntill very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how\nlate, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have",
        "come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\nlike it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him like\nheat—he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\nintolerable—and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse’s fire, looking very deplorable.\n\n“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said Emma.\n\n“As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be",
        "spared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\ngoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\ncame—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!”\n\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill’s\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\nhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\nhis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often",
        "the cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some\nrefreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\ndining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door.\n\n“No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\nhotter.” In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all\nher attention to her father, saying in secret—",
        "“I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet’s sweet easy\ntemper will not mind it.”\n\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\nback all the better—grown quite cool—and, with good manners, like\nhimself—able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.",
        "He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\nat last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\nover views in Swisserland.\n\n“As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,” said he. “I shall\nnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\nsketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to read—or my poem.\nI shall do something to expose myself.”\n\n“That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to",
        "Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave\nEngland.”\n\n“They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\nher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\nassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\nshall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\nwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\neyes may fancy—I am sick of England—and would leave it to-morrow, if I",
        "could.”\n\n“You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?”\n\n“_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in\nevery thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\nperson.”\n\n“You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice",
        "of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you\nnearly on a par with the rest of us.”\n\n“No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.”\n\n“We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want\nof a change. You will stay, and go with us?”\n\n“No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.”\n\n“But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.”",
        "“No—It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.”\n\n“Then pray stay at Richmond.”\n\n“But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of\nyou all there without me.”\n\n“These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.”\n\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others",
        "took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\ndisturbance on Miss Fairfax’s disappearance being explained. That it\nwas time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short\nfinal arrangement for the next day’s scheme, they parted. Frank\nChurchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much,\nthat his last words to Emma were,\n\n“Well;—if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.”\n\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from",
        "Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\nfavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\nsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\ntime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\nthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.",
        "Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of\nspirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated\ntoo much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took\ncharge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank",
        "Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise\nbetter. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never\nmaterially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness\nto mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole\nhours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\nseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine\nprospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to\nremove.",
        "At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\nChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing—looked\nwithout seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing\nwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\nshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\n\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first",
        "object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to\nher. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\ncared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\nwas gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the\nadmission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most\nanimating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own\nestimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people",
        "looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but\nflirtation could very well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\nWoodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves\nopen to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple\nGrove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and\nthoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less\nhappy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;",
        "and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,\nwhether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious,\nthey were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her\nfriend.\n\n“How much I am obliged to you,” said he, “for telling me to come\nto-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.”\n\n“Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that",
        "you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than\nyou deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to\ncome.”\n\n“Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.”\n\n“It is hotter to-day.”\n\n“Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.”\n\n“You are comfortable because you are under command.”\n\n“Your command?—Yes.”\n\n“Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,",
        "somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot be always\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\nrather than mine.”\n\n“It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\nmotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\nwith me. You are always with me.”\n\n“Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not",
        "begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour\nbefore.”\n\n“Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\nfirst in February.”\n\n“Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)—nobody\nspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\nnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”\n\n“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” replied he, with lively\nimpudence. “I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill",
        "hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and\nDorking on the other. I saw you first in February.” And then\nwhispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to\nrouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies and\ngentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\npresides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\nof?”\n\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great",
        "deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse’s presiding; Mr.\nKnightley’s answer was the most distinct.\n\n“Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\nthinking of?”\n\n“Oh! no, no”—cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could—“Upon no\naccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\nof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all\nthinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,",
        "(glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be\nafraid of knowing.”\n\n“It is a sort of thing,” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, “which _I_\nshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\nperhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party—_I_ never was in any\ncircle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—”\n\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\n\n“Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but",
        "some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body\nknows what is due to _you_.”\n\n“It will not do,” whispered Frank to Emma; “they are most of them\naffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen—I\nam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\nknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here",
        "are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\nentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\nthing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated—or two\nthings moderately clever—or three things very dull indeed, and she\nengages to laugh heartily at them all.”\n\n“Oh! very well,” exclaimed Miss Bates, “then I need not be uneasy.\n‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me, you know. I",
        "shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\nshan’t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on\nevery body’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall?”\n\nEmma could not resist.\n\n“Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you will be\nlimited as to number—only three at once.”\n\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not",
        "anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\n\n“Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\nKnightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old\nfriend.”\n\n“I like your plan,” cried Mr. Weston. “Agreed, agreed. I will do my\nbest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?”\n\n“Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his son;—“but we shall be",
        "indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.”\n\n“No, no,” said Emma, “it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\nWeston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\nhear it.”\n\n“I doubt its being very clever myself,” said Mr. Weston. “It is too\nmuch a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet\nare there, that express perfection?”\n\n“What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not know.”",
        "“Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\nguess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you understand?”\n\nUnderstanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\nenjoy in it—and so did Frank and Harriet.—It did not seem to touch the\nrest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\nKnightley gravely said,",
        "“This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\nelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.”\n\n“Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,” said Mrs. Elton; “_I_\nreally cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\nan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\npleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—You know",
        "who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well\nat Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\nplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in\nsummer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have\nwitty things at every body’s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I\nhave a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be\nallowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if",
        "you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We\nhave nothing clever to say—not one of us.\n\n“Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,” added her husband, with a sort of sneering\nconsciousness; “_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\nWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man—quite good for\nnothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?”\n\n“With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.”",
        "Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. “Happy\ncouple!” said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\nhearing:—“How well they suit one another!—Very lucky—marrying as they\ndid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!—They only knew\neach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!—for as to\nany real knowledge of a person’s disposition that Bath, or any public\nplace, can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is",
        "only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\nthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\nis all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\nhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\nof his life!”\n\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\nconfederates, spoke now.\n\n“Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—She was stopped by a cough. Frank\nChurchill turned towards her to listen.",
        "“You were speaking,” said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\n\n“I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate\ncircumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot\nimagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may\narise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I\nwould be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute\ncharacters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)",
        "who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an\noppression for ever.”\n\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\n\n“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning\nto Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I should like any\nbody fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a",
        "smile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt\nher, educate her.”\n\n“And make her like myself.”\n\n“By all means, if you can.”\n\n“Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming\nwife.”\n\n“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come\nto you for my wife. Remember.”\n\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every",
        "favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could\nsay? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\n\n“Now, ma’am,” said Jane to her aunt, “shall we join Mrs. Elton?”\n\n“If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\nready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall",
        "soon overtake her. There she is—no, that’s somebody else. That’s one of\nthe ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.—Well, I\ndeclare—”\n\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.\nWeston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man’s\nspirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at\nlast of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking\nquietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and",
        "quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views\nbeneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them to\ngive notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of\ncollecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to\nhave _her_ carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the\nquiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of\nthis day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many",
        "ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.\n\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\nlooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\n\n“Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use\nit. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could\nyou be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your",
        "wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?—Emma, I had not\nthought it possible.”\n\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\n\n“Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have helped it.\nIt was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”\n\n“I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it\nsince. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what",
        "candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\nforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\never receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\nso irksome.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Emma, “I know there is not a better creature in the world:\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\nunfortunately blended in her.”\n\n“They are blended,” said he, “I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,",
        "I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\nthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\nliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation—but, Emma,\nconsider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\nfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\nprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was",
        "badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she\nhad seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have\nyou now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at\nher, humble her—and before her niece, too—and before others, many of\nwhom (certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\nof her.—This is not pleasant to you, Emma—and it is very far from\npleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I will tell you truths while I can;",
        "satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\ntrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than\nyou can do now.”\n\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\nready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\nmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\ntongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,",
        "mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,\non entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome—then\nreproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no\nacknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with\nvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He\nhad turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look\nback, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they",
        "were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was\nvexed beyond what could have been expressed—almost beyond what she\ncould conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at\nany circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth\nof this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.\nHow could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And",
        "how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of\nconcurrence, of common kindness!\n\nTime did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\nit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\nto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\nfagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\ndown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble\nto check them, extraordinary as they were.",
        "CHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma’s thoughts all the\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\nnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a\nmorning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her",
        "father, was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for\nthere she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his\ncomfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond\naffection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct,\nbe open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not\nwithout a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, “How could\nyou be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I will tell you truths",
        "while I can.” Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If attention, in\nfuture, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had\nbeen often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in\nthought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.\nIn the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next\nmorning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular,\nequal, kindly intercourse.",
        "She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\nnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\nmight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while\nshe were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\nashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\nHer eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\n\n“The ladies were all at home.” She had never rejoiced at the sound",
        "before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\nderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\n\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\nShe heard Miss Bates’s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\nmaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait\na moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed",
        "both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse\nof, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she\nheard Miss Bates saying, “Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid\ndown upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.”\n\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did\nnot quite understand what was going on.\n\n“I am afraid Jane is not very well,” said she, “but I do not know; they",
        "_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\nMiss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I\nam very little able—Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you like?\nI am sure she will be here presently.”\n\nEmma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment’s fear of Miss Bates\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came—“Very happy and\nobliged”—but Emma’s conscience told her that there was not the same",
        "cheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner. A very\nfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\n\n“Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—and are\ncome to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\nme—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very trying for us to\npart with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful",
        "headache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters, you\nknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. ‘My dear,’\nsaid I, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were in her eyes\nperpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great\nchange; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, I\nsuppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do\nnot think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good",
        "fortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you were\nto see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one\ncannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as\npossible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy\nshe is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming\nto you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie\ndown upon the bed. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘I shall say you are laid down",
        "upon the bed:’ but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room.\nBut, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be\nwell. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\nbut your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door—I\nwas quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so\nhappened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the\nstairs, we did not know any body was coming. ‘It is only Mrs. Cole,’",
        "said I, ‘depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.’ ‘Well,’ said\nshe, ‘it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.’\nBut then Patty came in, and said it was you. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘it is Miss\nWoodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.’—‘I can see nobody,’\nsaid she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us\nkeep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. ‘If you must\ngo, my dear,’ said I, ‘you must, and I will say you are laid down upon",
        "the bed.’”\n\nEmma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\nbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\nsensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\nnaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when\nshe might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest",
        "regret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that the circumstances which\nshe collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might\nbe as much for Miss Fairfax’s advantage and comfort as possible. “It\nmust be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be\ndelayed till Colonel Campbell’s return.”\n\n“So very kind!” replied Miss Bates. “But you are always kind.”\n\nThere was no bearing such an “always;” and to break through her\ndreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of—",
        "“Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?”\n\n“To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge\nof her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible that any\nsituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\nMrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge is\nintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four\nmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.”",
        "“Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes—”\n\n“Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\nwould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, ‘No;’ for when\nJane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very\nmorning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite\ndecided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;\nexactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till",
        "Colonel Campbell’s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into\nany engagement at present—and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\nagain—and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\nmind!—but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\nfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\nsuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane’s answer; but she\npositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as",
        "Jane wished her; she would wait—and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\nwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\nthe least idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\nupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge’s situation, she\nhad come to the resolution of accepting it.—I did not know a word of it\ntill it was all settled.”\n\n“You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?”\n\n“Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon",
        "the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. ‘You _must_\n_all_ spend your evening with us,’ said she—‘I positively must have you\n_all_ come.’”\n\n“Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?”\n\n“No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\nhim off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\nand a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss",
        "Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\nrather fagged after the morning’s party. Even pleasure, you know, is\nfatiguing—and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\nenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\nand feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.”\n\n“Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\nmaking up her mind the whole day?”\n\n“I dare say she had.”",
        "“Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\nfriends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\npossible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.”\n\n“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in\nthe world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\nBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\nand elegant, in all Mrs. Elton’s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most",
        "delightful woman!—A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as\nto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\nare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\nsuch regard and kindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\npleasure.—And her salary!—I really cannot venture to name her salary to\nyou, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\nhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like\nJane.”",
        "“Ah! madam,” cried Emma, “if other children are at all like what I\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\nearned.”\n\n“You are so noble in your ideas!”\n\n“And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?”\n\n“Very soon, very soon, indeed; that’s the worst of it. Within a\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not",
        "know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\nsay, Come ma’am, do not let us think about it any more.”\n\n“Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\nMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before\ntheir return?”\n\n“Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a\nsituation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so\nastonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs.",
        "Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me\nupon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could not be before tea, because\nwe were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea, because I\nremember thinking—Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something\nhappened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room\nbefore tea, old John Abdy’s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old\nJohn, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father",
        "twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very\npoorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must go and see him\nto-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor\nJohn’s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he\nis very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,\nostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his\nfather without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us",
        "what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the\nchaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to\nRichmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane\nspoke to Mrs. Elton.”\n\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\ncould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill’s",
        "going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\n\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\naccumulation of the ostler’s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\nsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill—which messenger,\nhowever, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\nsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable",
        "account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\nback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\nresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\nseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\nCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\ngoing a good pace, and driving very steady.\n\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it",
        "caught Emma’s attention only as it united with the subject which\nalready engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill’s\nimportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax’s, struck her; one was every\nthing, the other nothing—and she sat musing on the difference of\nwoman’s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\ntill roused by Miss Bates’s saying,\n\n“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become",
        "of that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.—‘You\nmust go,’ said she. ‘You and I must part. You will have no business\nhere.—Let it stay, however,’ said she; ‘give it houseroom till Colonel\nCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\nme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.’—And to this day, I do\nbelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter’s.”\n\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of",
        "all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long\nenough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to\nsay of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nEmma’s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\nKnightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting",
        "with her father.—Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\ndecidedly graver than usual, said,\n\n“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\nand therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\na few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\nbesides the ‘love,’ which nobody carries?”\n\n“Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?”\n\n“Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time.”",
        "Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\nhowever, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\nagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going—her father\nbegan his inquiries.\n\n“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find my\nworthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been very\nmuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and",
        "Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\nattentive to them!”\n\nEmma’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\nand shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\nKnightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\nher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\nhad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.—\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified—and in",
        "another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\nfriendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself\nmade the first motion, she could not say—she might, perhaps, have\nrather offered it—but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was\non the point of carrying it to his lips—when, from some fancy or other,\nhe suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should\nchange his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.—He",
        "would have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.—The\nintention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his\nmanners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\nhappened, but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him, of\nso simple, yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the\nattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.—He left\nthem immediately afterwards—gone in a moment. He always moved with the",
        "alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\nnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\n\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\nhad left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure\nto talk over Jane Fairfax’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would\nshe regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew\nhow much his visit would be enjoyed—but it might have happened at a",
        "better time—and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\npleasanter.—They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be\ndeceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\ngallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\nhis good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\nfound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\n\nIn the hope of diverting her father’s thoughts from the",
        "disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley’s going to London; and going so\nsuddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\nEmma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the\neffect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,—interested,\nwithout disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax’s\ngoing out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.\nKnightley’s going to London had been an unexpected blow.",
        "“I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\nher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\nsituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\nbe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor’s always was with me.\nYou know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\nwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be",
        "induced to go away after it has been her home so long.”\n\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\ninto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\ndeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\nto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\nhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\nthing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short",
        "struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\n\nIt was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\ngravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\nsurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\nshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\nto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\ndisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.",
        "Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\nnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\njustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\nevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\nimaginary complaints.\n\n“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\nmore than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the",
        "temper. It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what\nwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill’s loss would be\ndreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”—Even Mr.\nWeston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman,\nwho would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be\nas handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over\nher broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.",
        "How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It\nwas also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.\nChurchill, the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both\nwith awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how\nFrank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw\nin a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith\nwould have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his",
        "wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into\nany thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the\nnephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the\ncause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.\n\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great\nself-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed\nnothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of",
        "strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might\nendanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill’s\ndeath with mutual forbearance.\n\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\nthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\nwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\ndeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a",
        "very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\nvisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\nHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\non Emma’s side.\n\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\nprospects were closing, while Harriet’s opened, and whose engagements\nnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her",
        "kindness—and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and\ntestify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to\nspend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation",
        "was refused, and by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough\nto write;” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it\nappeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\nthough against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\nunder severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him\ndoubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge’s at the time\nproposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite",
        "quite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms,\nnothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing\napprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought\nshe had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so\nherself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\ndisorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it",
        "otherwise—and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\nway of being useful. To take her—be it only an hour or two—from her",
        "aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\nhour that Jane would name—mentioning that she had Mr. Perry’s decided\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was\nonly in this short note:\n\n“Miss Fairfax’s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any",
        "exercise.”\n\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\ncounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\nanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates’s,\nin the hope that Jane would be induced to join her—but it would not\ndo;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing",
        "with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\nservice—and every thing that message could do was tried—but all in\nvain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite\nunpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\nworse.—Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\nbut, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\nthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.",
        "“Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\nbody—any body at all—Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied—and Mrs.\nCole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said so much—but, except\nthem, Jane would really see nobody.”\n\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\nshe feel any right of preference herself—she submitted, therefore, and",
        "only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece’s appetite and diet,\nwhich she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\nwas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\nthing:—Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they\ncould command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\ndistasteful.\n\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality",
        "was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In\nhalf an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from\nMiss Bates, but “dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being\nsent back; it was a thing she could not take—and, moreover, she\ninsisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.”\n\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of",
        "the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\nexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\nshe could have no doubt—putting every thing together—that Jane was\nresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\nHer heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\nfrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\ninequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little",
        "credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend:\nbut she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good,\nand of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been\nprivy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have\nseen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any\nthing to reprove.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill’s decease, Emma was",
        "called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and\nwanted particularly to speak with her.”—He met her at the parlour-door,\nand hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice,\nsunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\n\n“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”\n\n“Is she unwell?”\n\n“No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered the",
        "carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\nknow—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?”\n\n“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not\nill?”\n\n“Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”\n\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something",
        "really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\nwell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her\nfather, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon\nout of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for\nRandalls.\n\n“Now,”—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now\nMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”\n\n“No, no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t ask me. I promised my wife to",
        "leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\nbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”\n\n“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.—“Good\nGod!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened in Brunswick\nSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what\nit is.”\n\n“No, indeed you are mistaken.”—\n\n“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest",
        "friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—I charge you\nby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”\n\n“Upon my word, Emma.”—\n\n“Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour, that it\nhas nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What can be to be\n_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”\n\n“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is not in\nthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\nKnightley.”",
        "Emma’s courage returned, and she walked on.\n\n“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being _broke_ to you. I\nshould not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\nyou—it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In short, my dear\nEmma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don’t say that\nit is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse.—If we\nwalk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”",
        "Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\nasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\nthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\nconcern—something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\ncircumstances of the family,—something which the late event at Richmond\nhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\nchildren, perhaps—and poor Frank cut off!—This, though very",
        "undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little\nmore than an animating curiosity.\n\n“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they\nproceeded—speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\nthan with any other view.\n\n“I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I assure\nyou. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time.”\n\n“Has your son been with you, then?”\n\n“Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.”",
        "For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\nand demure,\n\n“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”\n\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my dear,” said\nhe, as they entered the room—“I have brought her, and now I hope you\nwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\ndelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—And Emma distinctly\nheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,—“I have",
        "been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.”\n\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\nthat Emma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\neagerly said,\n\n“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\nfind, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I have been\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do\nnot let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your",
        "distress, whatever it may be.”\n\n“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n“Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\nhear?”\n\n“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”\n\n“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”\n(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has\nbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is",
        "impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\nsubject,—to announce an attachment—”\n\nShe stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\nHarriet.\n\n“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an\nengagement—a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what will any\nbody say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\nengaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”\n\nEmma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,",
        "“Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?”\n\n“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her\neyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to\nrecover— “You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a\nsolemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth,\nand kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\nthemselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—It is so",
        "wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet\nalmost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.—I thought I knew\nhim.”\n\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two\nideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\npoor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.\n\n“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is a",
        "circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\nall comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of\nthem came to Highbury?”\n\n“Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma, very\nmuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\ncannot excuse.”\n\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend _not_ to\nunderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured",
        "that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\napprehensive of.”\n\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma’s countenance was as\nsteady as her words.\n\n“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\npresent perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\ndid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay,",
        "was attached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\nFortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\nfor at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\nbelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.”\n\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\nutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\nthan any thing else in the world could do.\n\n“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “On",
        "this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\nmight be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.—\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.”\n\n“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\nand I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to\ncome among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so",
        "_very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he\ncertainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\nattention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How\ncould he tell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that\nhe might not be making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong\nindeed.”\n\n“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—”\n\n“And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to",
        "look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\nbefore her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity,\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.”\n\n“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\nquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the\nfull use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been",
        "misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed\nto be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\npossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”\n\n“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much, much\nbeyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\nin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain",
        "of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every\ntransaction of his life.”\n\n“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\nmany, very many, good qualities; and—”\n\n“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.—“Mrs. Smallridge, too!\nJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\nsuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her",
        "even to think of such a measure!”\n\n“He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\nhim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him—or at\nleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—Till yesterday, I\nknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I\ndo not know how, but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery\nof what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined",
        "him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\nhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\nconcealment that had been carrying on so long.”\n\nEmma began to listen better.\n\n“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told me at\nparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\nus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It",
        "may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be\nunderstood. Don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to\ncondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\nsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\nfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\nboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\nconcealment.”",
        "“_His_ sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him\nmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”\n\n“Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that\nfamily! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have\nbeen a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at\nrest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly",
        "opposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when\nundue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with\nvery little persuasion.”\n\n“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for Harriet.”\n\n“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy, some time—and\nthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,",
        "to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\nhe could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much\nagitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a\ndifferent creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In\naddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\nvery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of—and there was\nevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”",
        "“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with\nsuch perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know\nof the engagement?”\n\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\n\n“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being\nin the world but their two selves.”\n\n“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\nidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very",
        "abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\nhypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—To come among us with\nprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to\njudge us all!—Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\ncompletely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\nand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\ncarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and",
        "words that were never meant for both to hear.—They must take the\nconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\nperfectly agreeable!”\n\n“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am very sure\nthat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might\nnot have heard.”\n\n“You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\nimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”",
        "“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\nas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”\n\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the\nwindow, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited\nhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let\nme intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at",
        "ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the\nbest of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her\nfavour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not\nfeel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance\nfor him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a\ngirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always\ngiven her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in",
        "spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And\nhow much may be said in her situation for even that error!”\n\n“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be excused\nfor thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\nFairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is not their’s,\nnor the world’s law.’”\n\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\nexclaiming,",
        "“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent\nof guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\nyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\ncondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate\nyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of\nthe most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your\ndaughter.”",
        "A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\nright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\nwas immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he\nshook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the\nsubject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and\npersuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companions\nsuggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;",
        "and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked\nit all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was\nbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best\nthing that Frank could possibly have done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\n“Harriet, poor Harriet!”—Those were the words; in them lay the\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\nthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved",
        "very ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much _his_\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet’s account, that gave the\ndeepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe\nof her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\nprophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend to\nHarriet Smith.”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but",
        "disservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\nnever have entered Harriet’s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of\nhaving encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have",
        "prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\nto have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend’s\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have\ndirected her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think\nof him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his\never caring for her.—“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid",
        "I have had little to do.”\n\nShe was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no\nlonger be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.—Her",
        "days of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well, and\nhappy, and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane’s eyes she had been a rival;\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She",
        "understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was\nlittle sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and",
        "judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet’s mind, producing\nreserve and self-command, it would.—She must communicate the painful\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\nbeen among Mr. Weston’s parting words. “For the present, the whole\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and\nevery body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”—Emma had",
        "promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\n\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\nridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\noffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through\nby herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to\nher, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat\nquick on hearing Harriet’s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had",
        "poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the\nevent of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—But of that,\nunfortunately, there could be no chance.\n\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room—“is\nnot this the oddest news that ever was?”\n\n“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\n\n“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!—you",
        "need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\nand, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but\nyou, but he said you knew it.”\n\n“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”—said Emma, still perplexed.\n\n“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\nanother this long while. How very odd!”",
        "It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that\nEmma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\nabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\ndisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\nher, quite unable to speak.\n\n“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?—You,\nperhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\nbody’s heart; but nobody else—”",
        "“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to\nanother woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if not\nopenly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I never had\nthe slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\nChurchill’s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”",
        "“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should you caution\nme?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”\n\n“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied\nEmma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and\nnot very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you\ndid care about him?”\n\n“Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?”\nturning away distressed.",
        "“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment’s pause—“What do you mean?—Good\nHeaven! what do you mean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then?—”\n\nShe could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\n\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\nher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\nin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma’s.",
        "“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could\nhave misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but\nconsidering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should\nnot have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other\nperson. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look\nat him in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than\nto think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And",
        "that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!—I am sure, but for\nbelieving that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my\nattachment, I should have considered it at first too great a\npresumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not\ntold me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\nmatches of greater disparity (those were your very words);—I should not\nhave dared to give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if",
        "_you_, who had been always acquainted with him—”\n\n“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely—“Let us understand\neach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\nspeaking of—Mr. Knightley?”\n\n“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—and so I\nthought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\npossible.”\n\n“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you\nthen said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could",
        "almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the\nservice Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from\nthe gipsies, was spoken of.”\n\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”\n\n“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that\nconsidering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\nnatural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to",
        "your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations\nhad been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of\nit is strong on my memory.”\n\n“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean; but I was\nthinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\ngipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr.",
        "Knightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\nstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\nwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity;\nthat was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to\nevery other being upon earth.”\n\n“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most unfortunate—most\ndeplorable mistake!—What is to be done?”\n\n“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At",
        "least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\nother had been the person; and now—it _is_ possible—”\n\nShe paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\n\n“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a\ngreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\nthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\nI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may",
        "appear—. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\nthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place\nthan between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if\nsuch a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be\nso fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should\nreally—if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss\nWoodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put",
        "difficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.”\n\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look\nat her in consternation, and hastily said,\n\n“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your affection?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“I must say that I\nhave.”\n\nEmma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient",
        "for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once\nopening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched—she admitted—she\nacknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet\nshould be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why\nwas the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet’s having some hope of a\nreturn? It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr.\nKnightley must marry no one but herself!",
        "Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\nfew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\nher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\ninconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\nher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck\nher with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in\nthe world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of",
        "all these demerits—some concern for her own appearance, and a strong\nsense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of _compassion_ to\nthe girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley—but justice\nrequired that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave\nEmma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even\napparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the\nutmost extent of Harriet’s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet",
        "had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so\nvoluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by the\nperson, whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from\nreflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet\nagain, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as\nto the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of\nJane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but",
        "of Mr. Knightley and themselves.\n\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\nand such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to\ngive the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\ndelight.—Emma’s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were\nbetter concealed than Harriet’s, but they were not less. Her voice was",
        "not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a\ndevelopment of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion\nof sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.—She listened with much\ninward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet’s\ndetail.—Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could\nnot be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the\nfeebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her",
        "spirit—especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own\nmemory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley’s most improved opinion of\nHarriet.\n\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\nthose two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\nfound her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse’s encouraging her to think of\nhim, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more",
        "than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different\nmanner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she\nhad been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking\ntogether, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\ndelightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\nalmost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and",
        "praise from him—and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with\nwhat she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being\nwithout art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\nfeelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had\ndwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet’s\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a",
        "compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because\nunsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour’s\nrelation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had\npassed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest\noccurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet,\nwere not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first,\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at",
        "Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he\nhad taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to\nhimself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way\nthan he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet\ncould not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking\nher, whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she (Miss\nWoodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and",
        "began talking about farming:—The second, was his having sat talking\nwith her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the\nvery last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when he first came\nin, he had said that he could not stay five minutes—and his having told\nher, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it\nwas very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which\nwas much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The",
        "superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article\nmarked, gave her severe pain.\n\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\nlittle reflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?—Is\nnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\nyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin—he might have Mr.\nMartin’s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\nspirit.",
        "“Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\nknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of\nit.”\n\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\nWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\n\n“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she, “but\nfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be\nthe rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may",
        "deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\nvery wonderful.”\n\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\nfeelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma’s side, to enable\nher to say on reply,\n\n“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the\nlast man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea\nof his feeling for her more than he really does.”\n\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so",
        "satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\nat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\nfather’s footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\nmuch agitated to encounter him. “She could not compose herself— Mr.\nWoodhouse would be alarmed—she had better go;”—with most ready\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\nanother door—and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous",
        "burst of Emma’s feelings: “Oh God! that I had never seen her!”\n\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\nthoughts.—She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\nrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\nfresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\nher.—How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\nbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the",
        "blindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about,\nshe tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every\nposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\nbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\nbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was\nwretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\nwretchedness.\n\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first",
        "endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father’s\nclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\n\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\ndeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?—\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—She looked back; she\ncompared the two—compared them, as they had always stood in her",
        "estimation, from the time of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as\nthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it—oh! had it, by\nany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.—She\nsaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\nKnightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had\nnot been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\nin fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a",
        "delusion, totally ignorant of her own heart—and, in short, that she had\nnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\n\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the\nknowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she\nreached; and without being long in reaching it.—She was most\nsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\nto her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind\nwas disgusting.",
        "With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of\nevery body’s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange\nevery body’s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken;\nand she had not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief. She had\nbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\nKnightley.—Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\nher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his",
        "attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\nHarriet’s;—and even were this not the case, he would never have known\nHarriet at all but for her folly.\n\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance every\nwonder of the kind.—The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\nbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\nsurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or",
        "thought.—Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—Such an elevation on her\nside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\nmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the\nsneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification\nand disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to\nhimself.—Could it be?—No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very\nfar, from impossible.—Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate",
        "abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one,\nperhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek\nhim?—Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal,\ninconsistent, incongruous—or for chance and circumstance (as second\ncauses) to direct the human fate?\n\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\nought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not, with a folly\nwhich no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the",
        "unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\nin the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been\nsafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\n\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts\nto Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of\nsuch a man till actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble,\nhad fewer scruples than formerly.—Her inferiority, whether of mind or",
        "situation, seemed little felt.—She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\nElton’s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\nKnightley’s.—Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?—Who but\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?—If\nHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII",
        "Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\nfirst in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\nbeen.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims",
        "could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he\nwould not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but\nstill, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of",
        "mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an\nendeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\nother creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew\nshe was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?—When the suggestions\nof hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she\ncould not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself\nnot unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by",
        "Mr. Knightley. _She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any\nidea of blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very\nrecent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he been by her\nbehaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed\nhimself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but\nfar, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright\njustice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to deserve",
        "the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself\nwhich was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one,\nat times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and\nbe overrating his regard for _her_.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be\nthe consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his\nlife. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at\nall, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but",
        "continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr.\nKnightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of\ntheir precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\nwould be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It\nwould be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what\nshe felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She\nwould not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.",
        "It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\nhoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be\nable to ascertain what the chances for it were.—She should see them\nhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\nhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know\nhow to admit that she could be blinded here.—He was expected back every\nday. The power of observation would be soon given—frightfully soon it",
        "appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\nresolved against seeing Harriet.—It would do neither of them good, it\nwould do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.—She was\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\nno authority for opposing Harriet’s confidence. To talk would be only\nto irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to\nbeg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it",
        "to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were\nallowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of\nothers—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act as\nif they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted,\nand approved, and was grateful.\n\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma’s",
        "thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours—Mrs. Weston, who had\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\nrelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\n\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates’s, and gone through his\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then",
        "induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\nmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a\nquarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates’s parlour, with all the\nencumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.\n\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at",
        "all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,\nand to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and\nMr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known;\nas, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\nwithout leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;",
        "or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”\nhe observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short—and very\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her",
        "daughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\nFairfax’s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,",
        "on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs.\nWeston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first\nreception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always\nfeeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the\ncause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good",
        "deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.\nWeston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief\nto her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so\nlong been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the\nsubject.\n\n“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\nmany months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was one\nof her expressions. ‘I will not say, that since I entered into the",
        "engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I\nhave never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering\nlip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my\nheart.”\n\n“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\nconsented to a private engagement?”\n\n“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to\nblame herself. ‘The consequence,’ said she, ‘has been a state of",
        "perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the\npunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\nPain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting\ncontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\nthing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\nconscience tells me ought not to be.’ ‘Do not imagine, madam,’ she\ncontinued, ‘that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on",
        "the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error\nhas been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that\npresent circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the\nstory known to Colonel Campbell.’”\n\n“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then excessively, I\nsuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led\nto form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\njudgment.”",
        "“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”\n\n“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have\ncontributed to make her unhappy.”\n\n“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably\nhad something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\nmisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\nconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was\nthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done",
        "amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\nand irritable to a degree that must have been—that had been—hard for\nhim to bear. ‘I did not make the allowances,’ said she, ‘which I ought\nto have done, for his temper and spirits—his delightful spirits, and\nthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\ncircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\nme, as they were at first.’ She then began to speak of you, and of the",
        "great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\nwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an\nopportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for every wish\nand every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had never\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself.”\n\n“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously, “which,\nin spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she",
        "must be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\nwere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\nFairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is\nall to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\nvery good—I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”",
        "Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\nwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved\nhim very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with\na great deal of reason, and at least equal affection—but she had too\nmuch to urge for Emma’s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square\nor to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston\nended with, “We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you",
        "know, but I hope it will soon come,” she was obliged to pause before\nshe answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could\nat all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\n\n“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston’s parting question.\n\n“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.”\n\nMrs. Weston’s communications furnished Emma with more food for",
        "unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\nsense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to",
        "find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\nnow.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other—what\nwas she?—Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s confidence on this\nimportant matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she",
        "ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill’s. Of all the sources of evil\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded",
        "that she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\nmore.\n\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\nThe weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,\nand nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the",
        "wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such\ncruel sights the longer visible.\n\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter’s side, and\nby exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\nher of their first forlorn tête-à-tête, on the evening of Mrs. Weston’s\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and",
        "dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\nHartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\nno pleasures had been lost.—But her present forebodings she feared\nwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that",
        "might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might\ntake place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\ncomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\n\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\nherself; and Mrs. Weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. They\nshould lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\nalso.—Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss",
        "Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\nHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near\nEnscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these\nlosses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of\ncheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be\nno longer coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at\nall hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their’s!—How",
        "was it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet’s\nsake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet’s\nsociety all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the\nfirst, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the\nbest blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma’s\nwretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that\nit had been all her own work?",
        "When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\na start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few\nseconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or\ncomposure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\nconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\nbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\nwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and",
        "leave her less to regret when it were gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the\nsame loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\nHartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\nsofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\nsummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,\nEmma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the",
        "exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and\nbrilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for\nthe serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry’s coming\nin soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she\nlost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—There, with spirits\nfreshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,\nwhen she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming",
        "towards her.—It was the first intimation of his being returned from\nLondon. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as\nunquestionably sixteen miles distant.—There was time only for the\nquickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a\nminute they were together. The “How d’ye do’s” were quiet and\nconstrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; they\nwere all well.—When had he left them?—Only that morning. He must have",
        "had a wet ride.—Yes.—He meant to walk with her, she found. “He had just\nlooked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred\nbeing out of doors.”—She thought he neither looked nor spoke\ncheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her\nfears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his\nbrother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.\n\nThey walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking",
        "at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\ngive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\nspeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\nencouragement to begin.—She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\nway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not\nbear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\nconsidered—resolved—and, trying to smile, began—",
        "“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\nsurprize you.”\n\n“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”\n\n“Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”\n\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\nhe replied,\n\n“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\nalready.”\n\n“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\nhim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called",
        "at Mrs. Goddard’s in his way.\n\n“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”\n\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\ncomposure,\n\n“_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\nhad your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\nme a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and",
        "a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”\n\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of\nhaving excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn\nwithin his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,\nin a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\n\n“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent\nsense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know you will not allow",
        "yourself—.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken\nand subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest\nfriendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!”—And in a louder, steadier\ntone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They will soon be in\nYorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.”\n\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\nof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,",
        "“You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you right.— I am\nnot in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going\non, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of,\nand I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\nwell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\nto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.”\n\n“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”—but",
        "checking himself—“No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am pleased that\nyou can say even so much.—He is no object of regret, indeed! and it\nwill not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\nof more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not\nfarther entangled!—I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\nmyself as to the degree of what you felt—I could only be certain that\nthere was a preference—and a preference which I never believed him to",
        "deserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded\nwith that sweet young woman?—Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\ncreature.”\n\n“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused—“I\nam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\nerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\nhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\nat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be",
        "natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I\nnever have.”\n\nHe listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\nnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\nclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself\nin his opinion. She went on, however.\n\n“I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story,",
        "probably—a common case—and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\nsex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\nas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\nHe was the son of Mr. Weston—he was continually here—I always found him\nvery pleasant—and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\ncauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last—my vanity\nwas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some",
        "time, indeed—I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\nattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\nnever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\nsituation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him; and\nno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself—except",
        "that I was _not_ blinded—that it was my good fortune—that, in short, I\nwas somehow or other safe from him.”\n\nShe had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as\nshe could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual\ntone, he said,\n\n“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose,\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has",
        "been but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\nmay yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no\nmotive for wishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be\ninvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\nwell.”\n\n“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma; “I believe\nthem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”\n\n“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. “So",
        "early in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a man chuses a\nwife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a\nprize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has\nbefore him!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love,\nfor Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every\nthing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as regards\nsociety, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in",
        "every point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not\nto be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his\nto bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to\ngive a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who\ncan do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be\nthe happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of\nfortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young",
        "woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\nby negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the\nworld for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her\nsuperior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to\nspeak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used\nevery body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a\nfortunate man indeed!”\n\n“You speak as if you envied him.”",
        "“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.”\n\nEmma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of\nHarriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\npossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\ndifferent—the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\nbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\n\n“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined, I",
        "see, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma, I\nmust tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\nnext moment.”\n\n“Oh! then, don’t speak it, don’t speak it,” she eagerly cried. “Take a\nlittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.”\n\n“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\nanother syllable followed.\n\nEmma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in",
        "her—perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would, she would listen.\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own\nindependence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be\nmore intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.—They had\nreached the house.\n\n“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.\n\n“No,”—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he",
        "still spoke—“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\ngone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added—“I stopped you\nungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\npain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to\nask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a\nfriend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like. I\nwill tell you exactly what I think.”",
        "“As a friend!”—repeated Mr. Knightley.—“Emma, that I fear is a word—No,\nI have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far\nalready for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it\nmay seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me,\nthen, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”\n\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\nof his eyes overpowered her.\n\n“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever",
        "the event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved\nEmma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be said.”—She could really\nsay nothing.—“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;\n“absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”\n\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\ndread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\nprominent feeling.\n\n“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of such",
        "sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\nconvincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\nmore. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\nwoman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell\nyou now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner,\nperhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a",
        "very indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you\nunderstand my feelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I\nask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”\n\nWhile he spoke, Emma’s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\nvelocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing a word—to\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\nHarriet’s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as",
        "complete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that\nshe was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to\nHarriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and\nthat her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had\nbeen all received as discouragement from herself.—And not only was\nthere time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant\nhappiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet’s secret had not",
        "escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.—It was\nall the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of\nthat heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him\nto transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the\nmost worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving\nto refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive,\nbecause he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for",
        "Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run\nmad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her\nbrain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her\nfor ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong\nas it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him,\nas most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite\nsmooth.—She spoke then, on being so entreated.—What did she say?—Just",
        "what she ought, of course. A lady always does.—She said enough to shew\nthere need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself. He\n_had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to\ncaution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;—she had begun\nby refusing to hear him.—The change had perhaps been somewhat\nsudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the\nconversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little",
        "extraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so\nobliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.\n\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human\ndisclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little\ndisguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the\nconduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very\nmaterial.—Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart",
        "than she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\n\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\nfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\nin his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill’s engagement, with\nno selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed\nhim an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.—The rest had been the work\nof the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings.",
        "The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank\nChurchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had\ngiven birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection\nhimself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only, in the momentary\nconquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did\nnot forbid his attempt to attach her.—The superior hopes which\ngradually opened were so much the more enchanting.—The affection, which",
        "he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already\nhis!—Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed\nstate of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could\nbear no other name.\n\n_Her_ change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the same\nprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\ndegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there had been",
        "a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\nof Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\nChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\nenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\nthat had taken him from the country.—The Box Hill party had decided him\non going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such\npermitted, encouraged attentions.—He had gone to learn to be",
        "indifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\ndomestic happiness in his brother’s house; woman wore too amiable a\nform in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only in those\nstriking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy\nbefore him, for much to have been done, even had his time been\nlonger.—He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day—till this\nvery morning’s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then,",
        "with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to\nfeel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving\nEmma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\nthat he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and\nhad walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best\nof all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the\ndiscovery.\n\nHe had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.— He",
        "heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill’s\ncharacter was not desperate.—She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of\nFrank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of\nfellow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\nwhat she had brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a",
        "little respite of suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of\nhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\ngreater when the flutter should have passed away.\n\nThey sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often it\nhad been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\nwestern sun!—But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing",
        "like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\nusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\ndaughter.\n\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in\nthe breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.—Could he have\nseen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but\nwithout the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the",
        "slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of\neither, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news\nhe had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much\nself-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him\nin return.\n\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma’s fever continued;\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\nsubdued—and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for",
        "such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to\nconsider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\nalloy. Her father—and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it\nwas a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most",
        "solemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the\nidea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger\nof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.—How\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\nhow to appear least her enemy?—On these subjects, her perplexity and",
        "distress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again\nthrough every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\nsurrounded it.—She could only resolve at last, that she would still\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\njust now for a time from Highbury, and—indulging in one scheme\nmore—nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation",
        "for her to Brunswick Square.—Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.—She did\nnot think it in Harriet’s nature to escape being benefited by novelty\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.—At any rate,\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\nevil day, when they must all be together again.",
        "She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\nleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\nup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\nan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\nliterally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\nproper share of the happiness of the evening before.\n\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the",
        "slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\nbrought her from Randalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must\ncontain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.—She was now in\nperfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\nwanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding\nany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.—It must be\nwaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a",
        "note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\nMrs. Weston.\n\n“I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have\nscarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially\ndisagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long\npreface.—We are quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the\nlittle nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like",
        "your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you\nwill never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a\nnorth-east wind.—I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of\nTuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing\nlast night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\n\n“Yours ever,\n“A. W.”\n\n\n[_To Mrs. Weston_.]\n\n\nWindsor—July.\n\n\nMY DEAR MADAM,\n\n\n“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;",
        "but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\nindulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But\nI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,",
        "and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when\nI first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret\nwhich was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to\nplace myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another\nquestion. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it\na right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,",
        "and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused, I\nshould have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say, what was your hope\nin doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing, every",
        "thing—to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining\nher promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther\nexplanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband’s\nson, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good,\nwhich no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value",
        "of.—See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit\nto Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might\nhave been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come\ntill Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person\nslighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father’s\ncompassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from\nhis house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour,",
        "during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I\nhope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I\ncome to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while\nbelonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very\nsolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest\nfriendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I\nought to add, with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped",
        "from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge\nmyself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,\nmore than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to\nme, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of\nintimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss\nWoodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the\ndeclaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would",
        "not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and\ndelightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young\nwoman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any\ntendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my\nwish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured\nplayfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each\nother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and",
        "were felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand\nme before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called\nto take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of\nconfessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;\nbut I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some\ndegree.—She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\nhave penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the",
        "subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take\nher wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember\nher telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her\nattentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards\nher will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what\nyou saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\nWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and",
        "procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of\nthat said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\nmyself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.—Of",
        "the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would never\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.—The delicacy\nof her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much\nbeyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope,\nknow her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her. She must\ntell you herself what she is—yet not by word, for never was there a",
        "human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I\nbegan this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard\nfrom her.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never\ncomplains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks.\nI know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\nPerhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am\nimpatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at",
        "Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much\nbetter yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I think\nof the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and\npatience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I\nrecollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve\nto be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!—But\nI must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to",
        "encroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\nthat you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the\nevent of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me\nthe happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early\nmeasures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not",
        "an hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,\nand she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength\nand refinement.—But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had\nentered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to\nleave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been\nwalking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make\nthe rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most",
        "mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can\nadmit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were\nhighly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been\nenough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think\nsufficient.—She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought\nher, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I\nthought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her",
        "judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed\nproper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever\nknown.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at\nDonwell?—_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before\ncame to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and\nwanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely\nrefused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now,",
        "however, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree\nof discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was\nbehaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,\nwas she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\nevery previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together\nbetween Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.—I was\nmad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her affection. I doubted it",
        "more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my\nside, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent\ndevotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of\nsense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly\nintelligible to me.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless\non her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to\nRichmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning,",
        "merely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I\nwas not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was\nthe injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined\nthat she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate\nmyself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\nbehaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well\nof me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it",
        "produced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she\nclosed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of\nwhose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation\nand hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has\nbeen so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane,’\nindeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling",
        "her by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in\nhearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of\nneedless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.\nHave patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with this\noffer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to\ntell me that we never were to meet again.—_She_ _felt_ _the_\n_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_",
        "_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.—This letter reached me on the very\nmorning of my poor aunt’s death. I answered it within an hour; but from\nthe confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on\nme at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other\nletters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting\nthat I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,\nremained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did",
        "not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was\ntoo busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We\nremoved to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from\nher, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by\nthe post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest\nreply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\nnot be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to",
        "have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she\nnow sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that\nif I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury\nwithin a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in\nshort, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near Bristol, stared me\nin the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and\ninstantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with",
        "that resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the\nsecrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,\nwas equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would\nnot she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how,\ntill I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of\nthe post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my\nuncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I",
        "spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\naway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\nwholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with\na deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the\nmarriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different\nsort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in\nopening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?—No;",
        "do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.\nDo not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.—I reached Highbury at\nthe time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I\nwas certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not\ndisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object\nof my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I\nhad to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much",
        "dearer, than ever, and no moment’s uneasiness can ever occur between us\nagain. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude\nbefore. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\never shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will\ndictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I\ndeserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good\nfortune. I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good fortune is",
        "undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,\n\nYour obliged and affectionate Son,\n\nF. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThis letter must make its way to Emma’s feelings. She was obliged, in\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\njustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\nit was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\nand almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the",
        "subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her\nformer regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any\npicture of love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till\nshe had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to\nfeel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had\nsupposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful\nto Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so",
        "happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have\nentered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as\never.\n\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\nshe desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston’s wishing it to\nbe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen\nso much to blame in his conduct.\n\n“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it seems long. I\nwill take it home with me at night.”",
        "But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\nmust return it by him.\n\n“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a\nmatter of justice, it shall be done.”\n\nHe began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered\nthe sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law a few\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”\n\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a",
        "smile, observed, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\nway. One man’s style must not be the rule of another’s. We will not be\nsevere.”\n\n“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to speak my\nopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—”\n\n“Not at all. I should wish it.”\n\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.",
        "“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows he is\nwrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to have\nformed the engagement.—‘His father’s disposition:’—he is unjust,\nhowever, to his father. Mr. Weston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on\nall his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every\npresent comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he did not\ncome till Miss Fairfax was here.”",
        "“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were that he might\nhave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely—but you\nwere perfectly right.”\n\n“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had\n_you_ not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him.”\n\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\naloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the",
        "head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\nthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\nreflection, thus—\n\n“Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous\ngame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—No judge of his\nown manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\nregardless of little besides his own convenience.—Fancying you to have",
        "fathomed his secret. Natural enough!—his own mind full of intrigue,\nthat he should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert\nthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\nand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with\neach other?”\n\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet’s\naccount, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\n\n“You had better go on,” said she.",
        "He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider\nwhether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the\npleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing\nto give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather\ndispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the\ninstrument’s coming if she could.”",
        "After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill’s\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\nmore than a word in passing.\n\n“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”—was then his remark. “You did behave\nvery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And having gone through\nwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\npersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax’s sense of",
        "right, he made a fuller pause to say, “This is very bad.—He had induced\nher to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme\ndifficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to\nprevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—She must have had much more\nto contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He\nshould have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;\nbut hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and",
        "remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the\nengagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of\npunishment.”\n\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\ndeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\nhowever, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\nexcepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear",
        "of giving pain—no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\n\n“There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\nEltons,” was his next observation.—“His feelings are natural.—What!\nactually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the engagement to\nbe a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it.—What a\nview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!—Well, he must be a most\nextraordinary—”\n\n“Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers.”",
        "“I hope he does,” replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the\nletter. “‘Smallridge!’—What does this mean? What is all this?”\n\n“She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge’s children—a\ndear friend of Mrs. Elton’s—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\nbye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?”\n\n“Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\nthe man writes!”",
        "“I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.”\n\n“Well, there _is_ feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered in\nfinding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\nher. ‘Dearer, much dearer than ever.’ I hope he may long continue to\nfeel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a very liberal\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.—‘Happier than I\ndeserve.’ Come, he knows himself there. ‘Miss Woodhouse calls me the",
        "child of good fortune.’—Those were Miss Woodhouse’s words, were they?—\nAnd a fine ending—and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\nThat was your name for him, was it?”\n\n“You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\nhope it does him some service with you.”\n\n“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion",
        "in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\nis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\nmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am\nvery ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers\nthe steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me\ntalk to you of something else. I have another person’s interest at\npresent so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank",
        "Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been\nhard at work on one subject.”\n\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\nEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\nwith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\nhappiness of her father. Emma’s answer was ready at the first word.\n“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be\nimpossible for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this",
        "answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her\nfather, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the\ninadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been\nthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to\ninduce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to\nbelieve it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not\nsuffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his",
        "persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father’s\ncomfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.\nWoodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt that it ought not to be\nattempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he\ntrusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her\nfather’s happiness—in other words, his life—required Hartfield to",
        "continue her home, it should be his likewise.\n\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\nan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\nthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\nbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\nin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there",
        "would be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of\nit, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced,\nthat no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the\nsubject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm\nconsideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole\nmorning, to have his thoughts to himself.\n\n“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I am sure",
        "William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\nask mine.”\n\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\nmoreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\nscheme.\n\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\nwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck\nwith any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as",
        "heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she\nmust of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she\nonly gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement\nin detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley’s\nmarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\nwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\n\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at",
        "Hartfield—the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their\nmutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in\nthe periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in\nall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\nmelancholy!\n\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\nof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,",
        "who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\nparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\ncharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\nevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\nfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead\nweight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\npeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state",
        "of unmerited punishment.\n\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\nKnightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like\nMr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\nconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\nthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\ncould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.",
        "CHAPTER XVI\n\n\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\nherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\nletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\n\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\nreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\nwas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her\nstyle, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—It",
        "might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only\ncould have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\n\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella’s invitation; and she was\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without\nresorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished,\nand had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to",
        "her—and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on\nher sister’s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very\npersuadable.—Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse’s carriage.—It was\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\nSquare.\n\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she could",
        "talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\nof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted\nher when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much\nmight at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the\nfeelings which she had led astray herself.\n\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s, or in London, made perhaps\nan unreasonable difference in Emma’s sensations; but she could not",
        "think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\n\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make—the\nconfession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing\nto do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till",
        "Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be\nthrown at this period among those she loved—and the evil should not act\non herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A fortnight, at\nleast, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more\nagitating, delight, should be hers.\n\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\nhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought",
        "to go—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\n_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of\nprospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should\nattend to any thing Jane might communicate.\n\nShe went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\nbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane",
        "had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all\nthe worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being\nstill unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home,\nto wait in the passage, and send up her name.—She heard Patty\nannouncing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had\nbefore made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard nothing but the\ninstant reply of, “Beg her to walk up;”—and a moment afterwards she was",
        "met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no\nother reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her\nlook so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,\nanimation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or\nmanner could ever have wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand;\nand said, in a low, but very feeling tone,\n\n“This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to",
        "express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely without\nwords.”\n\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\nsound of Mrs. Elton’s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her,\nand made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\ncongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\n\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\naccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.",
        "Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\nbody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped\nthe rencontre would do them no harm.\n\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton’s thoughts, and\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\nMiss Fairfax’s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what\nwas still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately",
        "in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to\nMrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady’s replies, she\nsaw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which\nshe had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it\ninto the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant\nnods,\n\n“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want",
        "opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already.\nI only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\nnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\ncreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.—But not a word\nmore. Let us be discreet—quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You\nremember those lines—I forget the poem at this moment:\n\n“For when a lady’s in the case,\n“You know all other things give place.”",
        "Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read——mum! a word to the\nwise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I? But I want to set your\nheart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My_ representation, you see, has quite\nappeased her.”\n\nAnd again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates’s\nknitting, she added, in a half whisper,\n\n“I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a\nminister of state. I managed it extremely well.”",
        "Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\npossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed\nwith,\n\n“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\ncharmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\ncredit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\nword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh! if you had",
        "seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!”—And when Mrs. Bates was\nsaying something to Emma, whispered farther, “We do not say a word of\nany _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\nphysician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.”\n\n“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,” she\nshortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not",
        "seem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So\nit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\nit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to\nour collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while\nthe fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party, you know, quite the\nsame party, not _one_ exception.”\n\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being",
        "diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\nshe supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\nevery thing.\n\n“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is impossible\nto say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane’s prospects—that\nis, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr.\nWoodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little\ncircle as you find us here.—Yes, indeed.—Charming young man!—that is—so",
        "very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And from\nher great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton\nfor being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of\nresentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now\ngraciously overcome.—After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it\nbeyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\n\n“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that",
        "anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\nis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\nhere, and pay his respects to you.”\n\n“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will\nbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits,\nand Mr. Elton’s time is so engaged.”\n\n“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to\nnight.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some pretence or",
        "other.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\nwanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\nhim.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you than I.—I do not\nknow what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half\nso many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them\nboth to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this\nfortnight.—However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose",
        "to wait on you all.” And putting up her hand to screen her words from\nEmma—“A congratulatory visit, you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.”\n\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily—!\n\n“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from\nKnightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\nconsultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.”\n\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton\ngone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.”",
        "“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\nCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\nlead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.”\n\n“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma. “I am almost certain that\nthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley was at\nHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”\n\n“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer, which",
        "denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton’s side.—“I do\nbelieve,” she continued, “this is the most troublesome parish that ever\nwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.”\n\n“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.\n\n“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\ntalked of.”\n\n“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;",
        "the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”\n\n“Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true. What a thinking brain you\nhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if\nwe could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would\nproduce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that\n_some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.—But hush!—not a\nword, if you please.”\n\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,",
        "not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\nevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\n\nMr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\nsparkling vivacity.\n\n“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But\nyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I",
        "should not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been\nsitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\nobedience—for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?”\n\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and\nthe walk he had had for nothing.",
        "“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be found. Very\nodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and\nthe message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.”\n\n“Donwell!” cried his wife.—“My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\nDonwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.”\n\n“No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\nto-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went",
        "over the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\nit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I\nam not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\nhousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very\nextraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to\nHartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—Miss\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it?”",
        "Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\n\n“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\nought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\nall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\nbe forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\nsure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his",
        "servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\nto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often\nobserved, extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such\na creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.\nAnd as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She\npromised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.”\n\n“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near the house,",
        "and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\nbelieve him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get\nthe speech of him. I have nothing to do with William’s wants, but it\nreally is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley\nto-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious\ninconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.”",
        "Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all\nprobability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\nKnightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\nMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\n\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\nattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\nan opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,",
        "“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\nnot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\nintroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\nhave been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been\nimpertinent.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual",
        "composure—“there would have been no danger. The danger would have been\nof my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by\nexpressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\ngreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\nof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\ndisgusted to such a degree as to—I have not time for half that I could",
        "wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\nmyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately—in short, if your\ncompassion does not stand my friend—”\n\n“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly, and\ntaking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\neven—”\n\n“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and",
        "artificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know\nthat I must have disgusted you.”\n\n“Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\nquickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\nhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?”\n\n“Very.”\n\n“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—just as\nI begin to know you.”",
        "“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\n\n“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,\nsmiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”\n\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\n\n“You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\nam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\nat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of",
        "deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\nmore to wait for.”\n\n“Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh!\nif you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\nopen!—Good-bye, good-bye.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMrs. Weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\nknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in",
        "wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\nany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of\nIsabella’s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both\nfather and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as\nhe grew older—and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years\nhence—to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,\nthe freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and",
        "Mrs. Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;\nand it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to\nteach, should not have their powers in exercise again.\n\n“She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she\ncontinued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis, in Madame\nde Genlis’ Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\nAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”",
        "“That is,” replied Mr. Knightley, “she will indulge her even more than\nshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\nbe the only difference.”\n\n“Poor child!” cried Emma; “at that rate, what will become of her?”\n\n“Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in\ninfancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing",
        "all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me\nto be severe on them?”\n\nEmma laughed, and replied: “But I had the assistance of all your\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt\nwhether my own sense would have corrected me without it.”\n\n“Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor\ngave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what",
        "right has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to\nfeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\nyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of\nthe tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much\nwithout doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many\nerrors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at\nleast.”\n\n“I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma. “I was very often",
        "influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I am\nvery sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\nspoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\nas you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\nthirteen.”\n\n“How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\nsaucy looks—‘Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor’s leave’—something which, you knew, I did",
        "not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\nfeelings instead of one.”\n\n“What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches\nin such affectionate remembrance.”\n\n“‘Mr. Knightley.’—You always called me, ‘Mr. Knightley;’ and, from\nhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal. I want\nyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.”\n\n“I remember once calling you ‘George,’ in one of my amiable fits, about",
        "ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\nyou made no objection, I never did it again.”\n\n“And cannot you call me ‘George’ now?”\n\n“Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr. Knightley.’ I will\nnot promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\ncalling you Mr. K.—But I will promise,” she added presently, laughing\nand blushing—“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I",
        "do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in\nwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.”\n\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\nservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice\nwhich would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\nfollies—her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\nsubject.—She could not enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned",
        "between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not\nbeing thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to\ndelicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship\nwere declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\ncircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\nher intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\nIsabella’s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being",
        "obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior\nto the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\n\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\nexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\nwhich appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be\nconsulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear\nto find Harriet different from what she had known her before.—Isabella,",
        "to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been\nequal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her.\nEmma’s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet’s\nbeing to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least.\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was\ninvited to remain till they could bring her back.\n\n“John does not even mention your friend,” said Mr. Knightley. “Here is",
        "his answer, if you like to see it.”\n\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\naccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to\nknow what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that\nher friend was unmentioned.\n\n“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr.\nKnightley, “but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to\nhave, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from",
        "making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\ncool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.”\n\n“He writes like a sensible man,” replied Emma, when she had read the\nletter. “I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\ngood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\nyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different",
        "construction, I should not have believed him.”\n\n“My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—”\n\n“He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,”\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile—“much less, perhaps, than\nhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\nsubject.”\n\n“Emma, my dear Emma—”\n\n“Oh!” she cried with more thorough gaiety, “if you fancy your brother\ndoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,",
        "and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from\ndoing _you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the\nadvantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish\nI may not sink into ‘poor Emma’ with him at once.—His tender compassion\ntowards oppressed worth can go no farther.”\n\n“Ah!” he cried, “I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\nas John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,",
        "to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did you\nnotice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly\nby surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of\nthe kind.”\n\n“If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some\nthoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\nunprepared for that.”\n\n“Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my",
        "feelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this\ntime for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I\nsuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\nthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\nas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, ‘Uncle seems\nalways tired now.’”\n\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other",
        "persons’ reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse’s visits, Emma having it in view that\nher gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first\nto announce it at home, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to\nher father at last!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of\nMr. Knightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would\nhave failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to",
        "come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She\nwas forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it\na more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she\ncould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\nin a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\nobtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,",
        "since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and Mr.\nKnightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\nconstant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he loved, next\nto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\n\nPoor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\nhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be",
        "a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor\nIsabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about\nhim affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he\nmust not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\ntaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but\nshe was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was\nintroducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the",
        "better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier\nfor having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to\nthe idea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny\nthat he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business\nbut Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his\nletters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so\nattached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the spot?—Yes.",
        "That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he\nshould be glad to see him every day;—but they did see him every day as\nit was.—Why could not they go on as they had done?\n\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To\nEmma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley’s, whose fond\npraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon",
        "used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the\nassistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\napprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\nconsider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled,\nand, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance\nof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse’s mind.—It was agreed upon,\nas what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided",
        "assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\nfeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\ntime or other—in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be so very\nbad if the marriage did take place.\n\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\nsaid to him in favour of the event.—She had been extremely surprized,\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she",
        "saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\nurging him to the utmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\nto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\nso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\nrespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\nso singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\nhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself",
        "been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\nlong ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\nwould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an\narrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\nWoodhouse had been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for\na marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe",
        "and Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr.\nWeston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the\nsubject better than by saying—“Those matters will take care of\nthemselves; the young people will find a way.” But here there was\nnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\nall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the\nname. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and",
        "without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\n\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing\ncould increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon\nhave outgrown its first set of caps.\n\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\nhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to",
        "familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of\nthe match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but\nthe wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\nwas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\n\n“It is to be a secret, I conclude,” said he. “These matters are always\na secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me\nbe told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.”",
        "He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\npoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\ndaughter?—he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of\ncourse, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\nafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\nhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon\nit would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the",
        "evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\n\nIn general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,\nand others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend\ntheir all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John\nKnightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their\nservants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection\nraised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.—There, the surprize was",
        "not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,\ncompared with his wife; he only hoped “the young lady’s pride would now\nbe contented;” and supposed “she had always meant to catch Knightley if\nshe could;” and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly\nexclaim, “Rather he than I!”—But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed\nindeed.—“Poor Knightley! poor fellow!—sad business for him.”—She was\nextremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good",
        "qualities.—How could he be so taken in?—Did not think him at all in\nlove—not in the least.—Poor Knightley!—There would be an end of all\npleasant intercourse with him.—How happy he had been to come and dine\nwith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.—Poor\nfellow!—No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh! no;\nthere would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\nthing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that she",
        "had abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan, living\ntogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who had\ntried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\nquarter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nTime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\nbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\nmorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her,",
        "when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After\nthe first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone,\nbegan with,\n\n“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”\n\n“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\n\n“I do not know which it ought to be called.”\n\n“Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\nto smile.”\n\n“I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very much afraid,",
        "my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”\n\n“Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\nor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”\n\n“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not\nthink alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\nher face. “Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet\nSmith.”\n\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\nthough she knew not what.",
        "“Have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “You have, I\nbelieve, and know the whole.”\n\n“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”\n\n“You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet\nSmith marries Robert Martin.”\n\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes,\nin eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were\nclosed.\n\n“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from Robert",
        "Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”\n\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\n\n“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were\nthe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\nor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need\nnot talk much on the subject.”\n\n“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself.\n“It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I",
        "cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say,\nthat Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\nhas even proposed to her again—yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”\n\n“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\ndetermined decision, “and been accepted.”\n\n“Good God!” she cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket,\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite",
        "feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\nexpressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was\nmore surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.—How—how\nhas it been possible?”\n\n“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send",
        "to John.—He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\nasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley’s. They\nwere going to take the two eldest boys to Astley’s. The party was to be\nour brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert\ncould not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely\namused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day—which\nhe did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an",
        "opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in\nvain.—She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\ndeserving. He came down by yesterday’s coach, and was with me this\nmorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\non my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\nthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer\nhistory when you see her.—She will give you all the minute particulars,",
        "which only woman’s language can make interesting.—In our communications\nwe deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s\nheart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did\nmention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\nbox at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and\nlittle John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one\ntime they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.”",
        "He stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\nwas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\nShe must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence\ndisturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\n\n“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\nsituation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your",
        "friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as\nyou know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\nyou.—As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in\nbetter hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\nsaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William\nLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”\n\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not",
        "to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,\n\n“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\nHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\n_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\ncannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\nunprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more",
        "determined against him, much more, than she was before.”\n\n“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I\nshould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\nvery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”\n\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe\nyou know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you\nperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him. I",
        "could suppose she might in time—but can she already?—Did not you\nmisunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things; of business,\nshows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of\nso many subjects, mistake him?—It was not Harriet’s hand that he was\ncertain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”\n\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma’s feelings, and so",
        "strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on\nHarriet’s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such\nemphasis, “No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,”\nthat she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some\nmeasure, premature. It could not be otherwise.\n\n“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to suppose me\nso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?—What do\nyou deserve?”",
        "“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\nany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\nyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\nHarriet now are?”\n\n“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he told\nme she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\ndoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that",
        "it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\nof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\nher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be\ndone, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,\nhe said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”\n\n“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\n“and most sincerely wish them happy.”",
        "“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”\n\n“I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.”\n\n“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\nHarriet’s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and\nfor Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as\nmuch in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have\noften talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.",
        "Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of\npleading poor Martin’s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her\nhappiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.—Much of this,\nI have no doubt, she may thank you for.”\n\n“Me!” cried Emma, shaking her head.—“Ah! poor Harriet!”",
        "She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\npraise than she deserved.\n\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\nfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\nstate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\ncollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till\nshe had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,\nshe could be fit for nothing rational.",
        "Her father’s business was to announce James’s being gone out to put the\nhorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\nhad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\n\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\nHarriet’s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\nsecurity.—What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of",
        "him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her\nown. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her\nhumility and circumspection in future.\n\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\nresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\nvery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\ndoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!",
        "Now there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would be a\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\n\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\nsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\npractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\nthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready",
        "to welcome as a duty.\n\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\nalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\nspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being\nobliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\ndisappointed.\n\nThey arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had\nthey been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for",
        "coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\nblind, of two figures passing near the window.\n\n“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just going to\ntell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.\nHe stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend\nthe day with us.—They are coming in, I hope.”\n\nIn half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see",
        "him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\nsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,\nthat Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had\nlong felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with\nJane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined",
        "the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer\na want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for Frank\nChurchill to draw near her and say,\n\n“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\nin one of Mrs. Weston’s letters. I hope time has not made you less\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”\n\n“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. I am",
        "particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy\nin person.”\n\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\n\n“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n“Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\ndoat upon her.”\n\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of",
        "Dixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\n\n“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”\n\n“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\npossible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know, you\nhad none.”\n\n“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”\n\n“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I had—it\nwould have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things,",
        "they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.—It\nwould have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of\nsecrecy and told you every thing.”\n\n“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.\n\n“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle’s being persuaded to pay a\nvisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\nare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I\ntrust, till we may carry her northward.—But now, I am at such a",
        "distance from her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we\nhave not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”\n\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\nthought, he cried,\n\n“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\nmoment—“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He paused.—She coloured and\nlaughed.—“I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish",
        "in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.—I assure you that I\nhave heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—He is a\nman whom I cannot presume to praise.”\n\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\nhis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\nand his next words were,\n\n“Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—and yet\nwithout being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It is a most",
        "uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair—a most\ndistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.—Just colour\nenough for beauty.”\n\n“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly; “but do\nnot I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\npale?—When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite forgotten?”\n\n“Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—”\n\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not\nhelp saying,",
        "“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I am\nsure it was a consolation to you.”\n\n“Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\nmiserable wretch!”\n\n“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was\na source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\nall in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the",
        "truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\nsituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.”\n\nHe bowed.\n\n“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of true\nsensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which\nbids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our\nown.”\n\n“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your side. You can\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete angel. Look",
        "at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\nthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.—You will\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\nuncle means to give her all my aunt’s jewels. They are to be new set. I\nam resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\nbeautiful in her dark hair?”\n\n“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that\nhe gratefully burst out,",
        "“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\nlooks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.”\n\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\nof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\ninfant’s appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\nbut it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of",
        "sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston\nhad been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes, however, the\nchild had been perfectly well again. This was her history; and\nparticularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her\nvery much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that\nshe had not done it. “She should always send for Perry, if the child\nappeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.",
        "She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was\na pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child\nseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been\nbetter if Perry had seen it.”\n\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\n\n“Perry!” said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\nFairfax’s eye. “My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\nPerry?—Has he been here this morning?—And how does he travel now?—Has",
        "he set up his carriage?”\n\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\nlaugh, it was evident from Jane’s countenance that she too was really\nhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\n\n“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never think of\nit without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\nit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,",
        "which sent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole\nblunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else,\nthough pretending to listen to the others?”\n\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\nsteady voice,\n\n“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They _will_\nsometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!”",
        "He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\nEmma’s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\nRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\nfelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\nregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\nsensible of Mr. Knightley’s high superiority of character. The\nhappiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the",
        "animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\nmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\nattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\nunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\nrecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party",
        "from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\nalone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied—unaccountable\nas it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\n\nHarriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but\nhaving once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\nself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with",
        "the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\nfullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend’s\napprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\nmeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—Harriet was most\nhappy to give every particular of the evening at Astley’s, and the\ndinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\nBut what did such particulars explain?—The fact was, as Emma could now",
        "acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\ncontinuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this, it must ever\nbe unintelligible to Emma.\n\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\nreason for thinking so.—Harriet’s parentage became known. She proved to\nbe the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\ncomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to",
        "have always wished for concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility\nwhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be\nas untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a\nconnexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley—or for the\nChurchills—or even for Mr. Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached\nby nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\n\nNo objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated",
        "liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet’s\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\nimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,",
        "and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and\noccupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\ntemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\nand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\nman;—or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\n\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,",
        "was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.—The\nintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\ninto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and\nmust be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\nmanner.\n\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\nno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,",
        "could impair.—Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\nbut as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\nherself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\nthe three, were the first to be married.\n\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.",
        "The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\nEmma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought\nto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\nallow them the fortnight’s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\nthe plan.—John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\napproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse—how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to\nconsent?—he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\ndistant event.",
        "When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\nalmost hopeless.—A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.—He began to\nthink it was to be, and that he could not prevent it—a very promising\nstep of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he was not\nhappy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter’s courage\nfailed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying\nhimself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in",
        "the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were\nover, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated—she could not\nproceed.\n\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse’s mind, or any wonderful change of his\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\nway.—Mrs. Weston’s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\nturkeys—evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the",
        "neighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\nWoodhouse’s fears.—He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\nson-in-law’s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\nnight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of\nthe Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of\nthem protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.—But Mr. John Knightley\nmust be in London again by the end of the first week in November.",
        "The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day—and Mr. Elton was called\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\njoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\n\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars",
        "detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\ninferior to her own.—“Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\nmost pitiful business!—Selina would stare when she heard of it.”—But,\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\n\nFINIS\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EMMA ***",

Out in Piccadilly its heartening warmth seemed to infuse",
        "into traffic and pedestrians alike a novel jauntiness, so that\nbus drivers jested and even the lips of chauffeurs uncurled into\nnot unkindly smiles. Policemen whistled at their posts--clerks,\non their way to work; beggars approached the task of trying to\npersuade perfect strangers to bear the burden of their\nmaintenance with that optimistic vim which makes all the\ndifference. It was one of those happy mornings.\n\nAt nine o'clock precisely the door of Number Seven Arundell",
        "Street, Leicester Square, opened and a young man stepped out.\n\nOf all the spots in London which may fairly be described as\nbackwaters there is none that answers so completely to the\ndescription as Arundell Street, Leicester Square. Passing along\nthe north sidewalk of the square, just where it joins Piccadilly,\nyou hardly notice the bottleneck opening of the tiny cul-de-sac.\nDay and night the human flood roars past, ignoring it. Arundell",
        "Street is less than forty yards in length; and, though there are\ntwo hotels in it, they are not fashionable hotels. It is just a\nbackwater.\n\nIn shape Arundell Street is exactly like one of those flat stone\njars in which Italian wine of the cheaper sort is stored. The\nnarrow neck that leads off Leicester Square opens abruptly into a\nsmall court. Hotels occupy two sides of this; the third is at\npresent given up to rooming houses for the impecunious. These are",
        "always just going to be pulled down in the name of progress to\nmake room for another hotel, but they never do meet with that\nfate; and as they stand now so will they in all probability stand\nfor generations to come.\n\nThey provide single rooms of moderate size, the bed modestly\nhidden during the day behind a battered screen. The rooms contain\na table, an easy-chair, a hard chair, a bureau, and a round tin\nbath, which, like the bed, goes into hiding after its useful work",
        "is performed. And you may rent one of these rooms, with breakfast\nthrown in, for five dollars a week.\n\nAshe Marson had done so. He had rented the second-floor front of\nNumber Seven.\n\nTwenty-six years before this story opens there had been born to\nJoseph Marson, minister, and Sarah his wife, of Hayling,\nMassachusetts, in the United States of America, a son. This son,\nchristened Ashe after a wealthy uncle who subsequently\ndouble-crossed them by leaving his money to charities, in due",
        "course proceeded to Harvard to study for the ministry. So far as\ncan be ascertained from contemporary records, he did not study a\ngreat deal for the ministry; but he did succeed in running the\nmile in four minutes and a half and the half mile at a\ncorrespondingly rapid speed, and his researches in the art of\nlong jumping won him the respect of all.\n\nThat he should be awarded, at the conclusion of his Harvard\ncareer, one of those scholarships at Oxford University instituted",
        "by the late Cecil Rhodes for the encouragement of the liberal\narts, was a natural sequence of events.\n\nThat was how Ashe came to be in England.\n\nThe rest of Ashe's history follows almost automatically. He won\nhis blue for athletics at Oxford, and gladdened thousands by\nwinning the mile and the half mile two years in succession\nagainst Cambridge at Queen's Club. But owing to the pressure of\nother engagements he unfortunately omitted to do any studying,",
        "and when the hour of parting arrived he was peculiarly unfitted\nfor any of the learned professions. Having, however, managed to\nobtain a sort of degree, enough to enable him to call himself a\nBachelor of Arts, and realizing that you can fool some of the\npeople some of the time, he applied for and secured a series of\nprivate tutorships.\n\nA private tutor is a sort of blend of poor relation and\nnursemaid, and few of the stately homes of England are without",
        "one. He is supposed to instill learning and deportment into the\nsmall son of the house; but what he is really there for is to\nprevent the latter from being a nuisance to his parents when he\nis home from school on his vacation.\n\nHaving saved a little money at this dreadful trade, Ashe came to\nLondon and tried newspaper work. After two years of moderate\nsuccess he got in touch with the Mammoth Publishing Company.\n\nThe Mammoth Publishing Company, which controls several important",
        "newspapers, a few weekly journals, and a number of other things,\ndoes not disdain the pennies of the office boy and the junior\nclerk. One of its many profitable ventures is a series of\npaper-covered tales of crime and adventure. It was here that Ashe\nfound his niche. Those adventures of Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator, which are so popular with a certain section of the\nreading public, were his work.\n\nUntil the advent of Ashe and Mr. Quayle, the British Pluck",
        "Library had been written by many hands and had included the\nadventures of many heroes: but in Gridley Quayle the proprietors\nheld that the ideal had been reached, and Ashe received a\ncommission to conduct the entire British Pluck\nLibrary--monthly--himself. On the meager salary paid him for\nthese labors he had been supporting himself ever since.\n\nThat was how Ashe came to be in Arundell Street, Leicester Square,\non this May morning.\n\nHe was a tall, well-built, fit-looking young man, with a clear",
        "eye and a strong chin; and he was dressed, as he closed the front\ndoor behind him, in a sweater, flannel trousers, and rubber-soled\ngymnasium shoes. In one hand he bore a pair of Indian clubs, in\nthe other a skipping rope.\n\nHaving drawn in and expelled the morning air in a measured and\nsolemn fashion, which the initiated observer would have\nrecognized as that scientific deep breathing so popular nowadays,\nhe laid down his clubs, adjusted his rope and began to skip.",
        "When he had taken the second-floor front of Number Seven, three\nmonths before, Ashe Marson had realized that he must forego those\nmorning exercises which had become a second nature to him, or\nelse defy London's unwritten law and brave London's mockery. He\nhad not hesitated long. Physical fitness was his gospel. On the\nsubject of exercise he was confessedly a crank. He decided to\ndefy London.\n\nThe first time he appeared in Arundell Street in his sweater and",
        "flannels he had barely whirled his Indian clubs once around his\nhead before he had attracted the following audience:\n\n  a) Two cabmen--one intoxicated;\n  b) Four waiters from the Hotel Mathis;\n  c) Six waiters from the Hotel Previtali;\n  d) Six chambermaids from the Hotel Mathis;\n  e) Five chambermaids from the Hotel Previtali;\n  f) The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis;\n  g) The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali;\n  h) A street cleaner;\n  i) Eleven nondescript loafers;\n  j) Twenty-seven children;",
        "k) A cat.\n\nThey all laughed--even the cat--and kept on laughing. The\nintoxicated cabman called Ashe \"Sunny Jim.\" And Ashe kept on\nswinging his clubs.\n\nA month later, such is the magic of perseverance, his audience\nhad narrowed down to the twenty-seven children. They still\nlaughed, but without that ringing conviction which the\nsympathetic support of their elders had lent them.\n\nAnd now, after three months, the neighborhood, having accepted",
        "Ashe and his morning exercises as a natural phenomenon, paid him\nno further attention.\n\nOn this particular morning Ashe Marson skipped with even more\nthan his usual vigor. This was because he wished to expel by\nmeans of physical fatigue a small devil of discontent, of whose\npresence within him he had been aware ever since getting out of\nbed. It is in the Spring that the ache for the larger life comes\non us, and this was a particularly mellow Spring morning. It was",
        "the sort of morning when the air gives us a feeling of\nanticipation--a feeling that, on a day like this, things surely\ncannot go jogging along in the same dull old groove; a\npremonition that something romantic and exciting is about to\nhappen to us.\n\nBut the southwest wind of Spring brings also remorse. We catch\nthe vague spirit of unrest in the air and we regret our misspent\nyouth.\n\nAshe was doing this. Even as he skipped, he was conscious of a",
        "wish that he had studied harder at college and was now in a\nposition to be doing something better than hack work for a\nsoulless publishing company. Never before had he been so\ncompletely certain that he was sick to death of the rut into\nwhich he had fallen.\n\nSkipping brought no balm. He threw down his rope and took up the\nIndian clubs. Indian clubs left him still unsatisfied. The\nthought came to him that it was a long time since he had done his\nLarsen Exercises. Perhaps they would heal him.",
        "The Larsen Exercises, invented by a certain Lieutenant Larsen, of\nthe Swedish Army, have almost every sort of merit. They make a\nman strong, supple, and slender. But they are not dignified.\nIndeed, to one seeing them suddenly and without warning for the\nfirst time, they are markedly humorous. The only reason why King\nHenry, of England, whose son sank with the White Ship, never\nsmiled again, was because Lieutenant Larsen had not then invented\nhis admirable exercises.",
        "So complacent, so insolently unselfconscious had Ashe become in\nthe course of three months, owing to his success in inducing the\npopulace to look on anything he did with the indulgent eye of\nunderstanding, that it simply did not occur to him, when he\nabruptly twisted his body into the shape of a corkscrew, in\naccordance with the directions in the lieutenant's book for the\nconsummation of Exercise One, that he was doing anything funny.\n\nAnd the behavior of those present seemed to justify his",
        "confidence. The proprietor of the Hotel Mathis regarded him\nwithout a smile. The proprietor of the Hotel Previtali might have\nbeen in a trance, for all the interest he displayed. The hotel\nemployees continued their tasks impassively. The children were\nblind and dumb. The cat across the way stropped its backbone\nagainst the railings unheeding.\n\nBut, even as he unscrambled himself and resumed a normal posture,\nfrom his immediate rear there rent the quiet morning air a clear",
        "and musical laugh. It floated out on the breeze and hit him like\na bullet.\n\nThree months ago Ashe would have accepted the laugh as\ninevitable, and would have refused to allow it to embarrass him;\nbut long immunity from ridicule had sapped his resolution. He\nspun round with a jump, flushed and self-conscious.\n\nFrom the window of the first-floor front of Number Seven a girl\nwas leaning. The Spring sunshine played on her golden hair and",
        "lit up her bright blue eyes, fixed on his flanneled and sweatered\nperson with a fascinated amusement. Even as he turned, the laugh\nsmote him afresh.\n\nFor the space of perhaps two seconds they stared at each other,\neye to eye. Then she vanished into the room.\n\nAshe was beaten. Three months ago a million girls could have\nlaughed at his morning exercises without turning him from his\npurpose. Today this one scoffer, alone and unaided, was\nsufficient for his undoing. The depression which exercise had",
        "begun to dispel surged back on him. He had no heart to continue.\nSadly gathering up his belongings, he returned to his room, and\nfound a cold bath tame and uninspiring.\n\nThe breakfasts--included in the rent--provided by Mrs. Bell, the\nlandlady of Number Seven, were held by some authorities to be\nspecially designed to quell the spirits of their victims, should\nthey tend to soar excessively. By the time Ashe had done his best\nwith the disheveled fried egg, the chicory blasphemously called",
        "coffee, and the charred bacon, misery had him firmly in its grip.\nAnd when he forced himself to the table, and began to try to\nconcoct the latest of the adventures of Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator, his spirit groaned within him.\n\nThis morning, as he sat and chewed his pen, his loathing for\nGridley seemed to have reached its climax. It was his habit, in\nwriting these stories, to think of a good title first, and then\nfit an adventure to it. And overnight, in a moment of",
        "inspiration, he had jotted down on an envelope the words: \"The\nAdventure of the Wand of Death.\"\n\nIt was with the sullen repulsion of a vegetarian who finds a\ncaterpillar in his salad that he now sat glaring at them.\n\nThe title had seemed so promising overnight--so full of strenuous\npossibilities. It was still speciously attractive; but now that\nthe moment had arrived for writing the story its flaws became\nmanifest.\n\nWhat was a wand of death? It sounded good; but, coming down to",
        "hard facts, what was it? You cannot write a story about a wand of\ndeath without knowing what a wand of death is; and, conversely,\nif you have thought of such a splendid title you cannot jettison\nit offhand. Ashe rumpled his hair and gnawed his pen.\n\nThere came a knock at the door.\n\nAshe spun round in his chair. This was the last straw! If he had\ntold Mrs. Ball once that he was never to be disturbed in the\nmorning on any pretext whatsoever, he had told her twenty times.",
        "It was simply too infernal to be endured if his work time was to\nbe cut into like this. Ashe ran over in his mind a few opening\nremarks.\n\n\"Come in!\" he shouted, and braced himself for battle.\n\nA girl walked in--the girl of the first-floor front; the girl\nwith the blue eyes, who had laughed at his Larsen Exercises.\n\nVarious circumstances contributed to the poorness of the figure\nAshe cut in the opening moments of this interview. In the first",
        "place, he was expecting to see his landlady, whose height was\nabout four feet six, and the sudden entry of somebody who was\nabout five feet seven threw the universe temporarily out of\nfocus. In the second place, in anticipation of Mrs. Bell's entry,\nhe had twisted his face into a forbidding scowl, and it was no\nslight matter to change this on the spur of the moment into a\npleasant smile. Finally, a man who has been sitting for half an\nhour in front of a sheet of paper bearing the words: \"The",
        "Adventure of the Wand of Death,\" and trying to decide what a wand\nof death might be, has not his mind under proper control.\n\nThe net result of these things was that, for perhaps half a\nminute, Ashe behaved absurdly. He goggled and he yammered. An\nalienist, had one been present, would have made up his mind about\nhim without further investigation. For an appreciable time he did\nnot think of rising from his seat. When he did, the combined leap",
        "and twist he executed practically amounted to a Larsen Exercise.\n\nNor was the girl unembarrassed. If Ashe had been calmer he would\nhave observed on her cheek the flush which told that she, too,\nwas finding the situation trying. But, woman being ever better\nequipped with poise than man, it was she who spoke first.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'm disturbing you.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Ashe. \"Oh, no; not at all--not at all! No. Oh,\nno--not at all--no!\" And would have continued to play on the",
        "theme indefinitely had not the girl spoken again.\n\n\"I wanted to apologize,\" she said, \"for my abominable rudeness in\nlaughing at you just now. It was idiotic of me and I don't know\nwhy I did it. I'm sorry.\"\n\nScience, with a thousand triumphs to her credit, has not yet\nsucceeded in discovering the correct reply for a young man to\nmake who finds himself in the appalling position of being\napologized to by a pretty girl. If he says nothing he seems",
        "sullen and unforgiving. If he says anything he makes a fool of\nhimself. Ashe, hesitating between these two courses, suddenly\ncaught sight of the sheet of paper over which he had been poring\nso long.\n\n\"What is a wand of death?\" he asked.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"A wand of death?\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\nThe delirium of the conversation was too much for Ashe. He burst\nout laughing. A moment later the girl did the same. And\nsimultaneously embarrassment ceased to be.",
        "\"I suppose you think I'm mad?\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Well, I should have been if you hadn't come in.\"\n\n\"Why was that?\"\n\n\"I was trying to write a detective story.\"\n\n\"I was wondering whether you were a writer.\"\n\n\"Do you write?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you ever read Home Gossip?\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"You are quite right to speak in that thankful tone. It's a\nhorrid little paper--all brown-paper patterns and advice to the\nlovelorn and puzzles. I do a short story for it every week, under",
        "various names. A duke or an earl goes with each story. I loathe\nit intensely.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for your troubles,\" said Ashe firmly; \"but we are\nwandering from the point. What is a wand of death?\"\n\n\"A wand of death?\"\n\n\"A wand of death.\"\n\nThe girl frowned reflectively.\n\n\"Why, of course; it's the sacred ebony stick stolen from the\nIndian temple, which is supposed to bring death to whoever\npossesses it. The hero gets hold of it, and the priests dog him",
        "and send him threatening messages. What else could it be?\"\n\nAshe could not restrain his admiration.\n\n\"This is genius!\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Absolute genius. I see it all. The hero calls in Gridley Quayle,\nand that patronizing ass, by the aid of a series of wicked\ncoincidences, solves the mystery; and there am I, with another\nmonth's work done.\"\n\nShe looked at him with interest.\n\n\"Are you the author of Gridley Quayle?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you read him!\"",
        "\"I do not read him! But he is published by the same firm that\npublishes Home Gossip, and I can't help seeing his cover\nsometimes while I am waiting in the waiting room to see the\neditress.\"\n\nAshe felt like one who meets a boyhood's chum on a desert island.\nHere was a real bond between them.\n\n\"Does the Mammoth publish you, too? Why, we are comrades in\nmisfortune--fellow serfs! We should be friends. Shall we be\nfriends?\"\n\n\"I should be delighted.\"",
        "\"Shall we shake hands, sit down, and talk about ourselves a\nlittle?\"\n\n\"But I am keeping you from your work.\"\n\n\"An errand of mercy.\"\n\nShe sat down. It is a simple act, this of sitting down; but, like\neverything else, it may be an index to character. There was\nsomething wholly satisfactory to Ashe in the manner in which this\ngirl did it. She neither seated herself on the extreme edge of\nthe easy-chair, as one braced for instant flight; nor did she",
        "wallow in the easy-chair, as one come to stay for the week-end.\nShe carried herself in an unconventional situation with an\nunstudied self-confidence that he could not sufficiently admire.\n\nEtiquette is not rigid in Arundell Street; but, nevertheless, a\ngirl in a first-floor front may be excused for showing surprise\nand hesitation when invited to a confidential chat with a\nsecond-floor front young man whom she has known only five\nminutes. But there is a freemasonry among those who live in large",
        "cities on small earnings.\n\n\"Shall we introduce ourselves?\" said Ashe. \"Or did Mrs. Bell tell\nyou my name? By the way, you have not been here long, have you?\"\n\n\"I took my room day before yesterday. But your name, if you are\nthe author of Gridley Quayle, is Felix Clovelly, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no! Surely you don't think anyone's name could\nreally be Felix Clovelly? That is only the cloak under which I\nhide my shame. My real name is Marson--Ashe Marson. And yours?\"",
        "\"Valentine--Joan Valentine.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me the story of your life, or shall I tell mine\nfirst?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I have any particular story. I am an\nAmerican.\"\n\n\"Not American!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it is too extraordinary, too much like a Gridley Quayle\ncoincidence. I am an American!\"\n\n\"Well, so are a good many other people.\"\n\n\"You miss the point. We are not only fellow serfs--we are fellow\nexiles. You can't round the thing off by telling me you were born",
        "in Hayling, Massachusetts, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I was born in New York.\"\n\n\"Surely not! I didn't know anybody was.\"\n\n\"Why Hayling, Massachusetts?\"\n\n\"That was where I was born.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I never heard of it.\"\n\n\"Strange. I know your home town quite well. But I have not yet\nmade my birthplace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall.\nI am beginning to realize that I am one of the failures.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Twenty-six.\"\n\n\"You are only twenty-six and you call yourself a failure? I think",
        "that is a shameful thing to say.\"\n\n\"What would you call a man of twenty-six whose only means of\nmaking a living was the writing of Gridley Quayle stories--an\nempire builder?\"\n\n\"How do you know it's your only means of making a living? Why\ndon't you try something new?\"\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\"How should I know? Anything that comes along. Good gracious, Mr.\nMarson; here you are in the biggest city in the world, with\nchances for adventure simply shrieking to you on every side.\"",
        "\"I must be deaf. The only thing I have heard shrieking to me on\nevery side has been Mrs. Bell--for the week's rent.\"\n\n\"Read the papers. Read the advertisement columns. I'm sure you\nwill find something sooner or later. Don't get into a groove. Be\nan adventurer. Snatch at the next chance, whatever it is.\"\n\nAshe nodded.\n\n\"Continue,\" he said. \"Proceed. You are stimulating me.\"\n\n\"But why should you want a girl like me to stimulate you? Surely",
        "London is enough to do it without my help? You can always find\nsomething new, surely? Listen, Mr. Marson. I was thrown on my own\nresources about five years ago--never mind how. Since then I have\nworked in a shop, done typewriting, been on the stage, had a\nposition as governess, been a lady's maid--\"\n\n\"A what! A lady's maid?\"\n\n\"Why not? It was all experience; and I can assure you I would\nmuch rather be a lady's maid than a governess.\"\n\n\"I think I know what you mean. I was a private tutor once. I",
        "suppose a governess is the female equivalent. I have often\nwondered what General Sherman would have said about private\ntutoring if he expressed himself so breezily about mere war. Was\nit fun being a lady's maid?\"\n\n\"It was pretty good fun; and it gave me an opportunity of\nstudying the aristocracy in its native haunts, which has made me\nthe Gossip's established authority on dukes and earls.\"\n\nAshe drew a deep breath--not a scientific deep breath, but one of\nadmiration.",
        "\"You are perfectly splendid!\"\n\n\"Splendid?\"\n\n\"I mean, you have such pluck.\"\n\n\"Oh, well; I keep on trying. I'm twenty-three and I haven't\nachieved anything much yet; but I certainly don't feel like\nsitting back and calling myself a failure.\"\n\nAshe made a grimace.\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I've got it.\"\n\n\"I meant you to,\" said Joan placidly. \"I hope I haven't bored you\nwith my autobiography, Mr. Marson. I'm not setting myself up as a\nshining example; but I do like action and hate stagnation.\"",
        "\"You are absolutely wonderful!\" said Ashe. \"You are a human\ncorrespondence course in efficiency, one of the ones you see\nadvertised in the back pages of the magazines, beginning, 'Young\nman, are you earning enough?' with a picture showing the dead\nbeat gazing wistfully at the boss' chair. You would galvanize a\njellyfish.\"\n\n\"If I have really stimulated you-----\"\n\n\"I think that was another slam,\" said Ashe pensively. \"Well, I\ndeserve it. Yes, you have stimulated me. I feel like a new man.",
        "It's queer that you should have come to me right on top of\neverything else. I don't remember when I have felt so restless\nand discontented as this morning.\"\n\n\"It's the Spring.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is. I feel like doing something big and\nadventurous.\"\n\n\"Well, do it then. You have a Morning Post on the table. Have you\nread it yet?\"\n\n\"I glanced at it.\"\n\n\"But you haven't read the advertisement pages? Read them. They\nmay contain just the opening you want.\"",
        "\"Well, I'll do it; but my experience of advertisement pages is\nthat they are monopolized by philanthropists who want to lend you\nany sum from ten to a hundred thousand pounds on your note of\nhand only. However, I will scan them.\"\n\nJoan rose and held out her hand.\n\n\"Good-by, Mr. Marson. You've got your detective story to write,\nand I have to think out something with a duke in it by to-night;\nso I must be going.\" She smiled. \"We have traveled a good way",
        "from the point where we started, but I may as well go back to it\nbefore I leave you. I'm sorry I laughed at you this morning.\"\n\nAshe clasped her hand in a fervent grip.\n\n\"I'm not. Come and laugh at me whenever you feel like it. I like\nbeing laughed at. Why, when I started my morning exercises, half\nof London used to come and roll about the sidewalks in\nconvulsions. I'm not an attraction any longer and it makes me\nfeel lonesome. There are twenty-nine of those Larsen Exercises",
        "and you saw only part of the first. You have done so much for me\nthat if I can be of any use to you, in helping you to greet the\nday with a smile, I shall be only too proud. Exercise Six is a\nsure-fire mirth-provoker; I'll start with it to-morrow morning. I\ncan also recommend Exercise Eleven--a scream! Don't miss it.\"\n\n\"Very well. Well, good-by for the present.\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\nShe was gone; and Ashe, thrilling with new emotions, stared at",
        "the door which had closed behind her. He felt as though he had\nbeen wakened from sleep by a powerful electric shock.\n\nClose beside the sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now\nluminous and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay\nthe Morning Post, the advertisement columns of which he had\npromised her to explore. The least he could do was to begin at\nonce.\n\nHis spirits sank as he did so. It was the same old game. A Mr.\nBrian MacNeill, though doing no business with minors, was",
        "willing--even anxious--to part with his vast fortune to anyone\nover the age of twenty-one whose means happened to be a trifle\nstraitened. This good man required no security whatever; nor did\nhis rivals in generosity, the Messrs. Angus Bruce, Duncan\nMacfarlane, Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They, too,\nshowed a curious distaste for dealing with minors; but anyone of\nmaturer years could simply come round to the office and help\nhimself.",
        "Ashe threw the paper down wearily. He had known all along that it\nwas no good. Romance was dead and the unexpected no longer\nhappened. He picked up his pen and began to write \"The Adventure\nof the Wand of Death.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIn a bedroom on the fourth floor of the Hotel Guelph in\nPiccadilly, the Honorable Frederick Threepwood sat in bed, with\nhis knees drawn up to his chin, and glared at the day with the\nglare of mental anguish. He had very little mind, but what he had\nwas suffering.",
        "He had just remembered. It is like that in this life. You wake\nup, feeling as fit as a fiddle; you look at the window and see\nthe sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you begin to plan a\nperfectly corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you\nmet last night at the National Sporting Club; and then--you\nremember.\n\n\"Oh, dash it!\" said the Honorable Freddie. And after a moment's\npause: \"And I was feeling so dashed happy!\"\n\nFor the space of some minutes he remained plunged in sad",
        "meditation; then, picking up the telephone from the table at his\nside, he asked for a number.\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"Hello!\" responded a rich voice at the other end of the wire.\n\n\"Oh, I say! Is that you, Dickie?\"\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"This is Freddie Threepwood. I say, Dickie, old top, I want to\nsee you about something devilish important. Will you be in at\ntwelve?\"\n\n\"Certainly. What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"I can't explain over the wire; but it's deuced serious.\"",
        "\"Very well. By the way, Freddie, congratulations on the\nengagement.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old man. Thanks very much, and so on--but you won't\nforget to be in at twelve, will you? Good-by.\"\n\nHe replaced the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed, for he\nhad heard the door handle turn. When the door opened he was\ngiving a correct representation of a young man wasting no time in\nbeginning his toilet for the day.\n\nAn elderly, thin-faced, bald-headed, amiably vacant man entered.",
        "He regarded the Honorable Freddie with a certain disfavor.\n\n\"Are you only just getting up, Frederick?\"\n\n\"Hello, gov'nor. Good morning. I shan't be two ticks now.\"\n\n\"You should have been out and about two hours ago. The day is\nglorious.\"\n\n\"Shan't be more than a minute, gov'nor, now. Just got to have a\ntub and then chuck on a few clothes.\"\n\nHe disappeared into the bathroom. His father, taking a chair,\nplaced the tips of his fingers together and in this attitude",
        "remained motionless, a figure of disapproval and suppressed\nannoyance.\n\nLike many fathers in his rank of life, the Earl of Emsworth had\nsuffered much through that problem which, with the exception of\nMr. Lloyd-George, is practically the only fly in the British\naristocratic amber--the problem of what to do with the younger\nsons.\n\nIt is useless to try to gloss over the fact--in the aristocratic\nfamilies of Great Britain the younger son is not required.",
        "Apart, however, from the fact that he was a younger son, and, as\nsuch, a nuisance in any case, the honorable Freddie had always\nannoyed his father in a variety of ways. The Earl of Emsworth was\nso constituted that no man or thing really had the power to\ntrouble him deeply; but Freddie had come nearer to doing it than\nanybody else in the world. There had been a consistency, a\nperseverance, about his irritating performances that had acted on",
        "the placid peer as dripping water on a stone. Isolated acts of\nannoyance would have been powerless to ruffle his calm; but\nFreddie had been exploding bombs under his nose since he went to\nEton.\n\nHe had been expelled from Eton for breaking out at night and\nroaming the streets of Windsor in a false mustache. He had been\nsent down from Oxford for pouring ink from a second-story window\non the junior dean of his college. He had spent two years at an",
        "expensive London crammer's and failed to pass into the army. He\nhad also accumulated an almost record series of racing debts,\nbesides as shady a gang of friends--for the most part vaguely\nconnected with the turf--as any young man of his age ever\ncontrived to collect.\n\nThese things try the most placid of parents; and finally Lord\nEmsworth had put his foot down. It was the only occasion in his\nlife when he had acted with decision, and he did it with the",
        "accumulated energy of years. He stopped his son's allowance,\nhaled him home to Blandings Castle, and kept him there so\nrelentlessly that until the previous night, when they had come up\ntogether by an afternoon train, Freddie had not seen London for\nnearly a year.\n\nPossibly it was the reflection that, whatever his secret\ntroubles, he was at any rate once more in his beloved metropolis\nthat caused Freddie at this point to burst into discordant song.\nHe splashed and warbled simultaneously.",
        "Lord Emsworth's frown deepened and he began to tap his fingers\ntogether irritably. Then his brow cleared and a pleased smile\nflickered over his face. He, too, had remembered.\n\nWhat Lord Emsworth remembered was this: Late in the previous\nautumn the next estate to Blandings had been rented by an\nAmerican, a Mr. Peters--a man with many millions, chronic\ndyspepsia, and one fair daughter--Aline. The two families had\nmet. Freddie and Aline had been thrown together; and, only a few",
        "days before, the engagement had been announced. And for Lord\nEmsworth the only flaw in this best of all possible worlds had\nbeen removed.\n\nYes, he was glad Freddie was engaged to be married to Aline\nPeters. He liked Aline. He liked Mr. Peters. Such was the relief\nhe experienced that he found himself feeling almost affectionate\ntoward Freddie, who emerged from the bathroom at this moment,\nclad in a pink bathrobe, to find the paternal wrath evaporated,\nand all, so to speak, right with the world.",
        "Nevertheless, he wasted no time about his dressing. He was always\nill at ease in his father's presence and he wished to be\nelsewhere with all possible speed. He sprang into his trousers\nwith such energy that he nearly tripped himself up. As he\ndisentangled himself he recollected something that had slipped\nhis memory.\n\n\"By the way, gov'nor, I met an old pal of mine last night and\nasked him down to Blandings this week. That's all right, isn't",
        "it? He's a man named Emerson, an American. He knows Aline quite\nwell, he says--has known her since she was a kid.\"\n\n\"I do not remember any friend of yours named Emerson.\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I met him last night for the first\ntime. But it's all right. He's a good chap, don't you know!\n--and all that sort of rot.\"\n\nLord Emsworth was feeling too benevolent to raise the objections\nhe certainly would have raised had his mood been less sunny.\n\n\"Certainly; let him come if he wishes.\"",
        "\"Thanks, gov'nor.\"\n\nFreddie completed his toilet.\n\n\"Doing anything special this morning, gov'nor? I rather thought\nof getting a bit of breakfast and then strolling round a bit.\nHave you had breakfast?\"\n\n\"Two hours ago. I trust that in the course of your strolling you\nwill find time to call at Mr. Peters' and see Aline. I shall be\ngoing there directly after lunch. Mr. Peters wishes to show me\nhis collection of--I think scarabs was the word he used.\"",
        "\"Oh, I'll look in all right! Don't you worry! Or if I don't I'll\ncall the old boy up on the phone and pass the time of day. Well,\nI rather think I'll be popping off and getting that bit of\nbreakfast--what?\"\n\nSeveral comments on this speech suggested themselves to Lord\nEmsworth. In the first place, he did not approve of Freddie's\nallusion to one of America's merchant princes as \"the old boy.\"\nSecond, his son's attitude did not strike him as the ideal",
        "attitude of a young man toward his betrothed. There seemed to be\na lack of warmth. But, he reflected, possibly this was simply\nanother manifestation of the modern spirit; and in any case it\nwas not worth bothering about; so he offered no criticism.\n\nPresently, Freddie having given his shoes a flick with a silk\nhandkerchief and thrust the latter carefully up his sleeve, they\npassed out and down into the main lobby of the hotel, where they",
        "parted--Freddie to his bit of breakfast; his father to potter\nabout the streets and kill time until luncheon. London was always\na trial to the Earl of Emsworth. His heart was in the country and\nthe city held no fascinations for him.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nOn one of the floors in one of the buildings in one of the\nstreets that slope precipitously from the Strand to the Thames\nEmbankment, there is a door that would be all the better for a",
        "lick of paint, which bears what is perhaps the most modest and\nunostentatious announcement of its kind in London. The grimy\nground-glass displays the words:\n\n                  R. JONES\n\nSimply that and nothing more. It is rugged in its simplicity.\nYou wonder, as you look at it--if you have time to look at and\nwonder about these things--who this Jones may be; and what is the\nbusiness he conducts with such coy reticence.\n\nAs a matter of fact, these speculations had passed through",
        "suspicious minds at Scotland Yard, which had for some time taken\nnot a little interest in R. Jones. But beyond ascertaining that\nhe bought and sold curios, did a certain amount of bookmaking\nduring the flat-racing season, and had been known to lend money,\nScotland Yard did not find out much about Mr. Jones and presently\ndismissed him from its thoughts.\n\nOn the theory, given to the world by William Shakespeare, that it\nis the lean and hungry-looking men who are dangerous, and that",
        "the \"fat, sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights,\" are\nharmless, R. Jones should have been above suspicion. He was\ninfinitely the fattest man in the west-central postal district of\nLondon. He was a round ball of a man, who wheezed when he walked\nupstairs, which was seldom, and shook like jelly if some tactless\nfriend, wishing to attract his attention, tapped him unexpectedly\non the shoulder. But this occurred still less frequently than his",
        "walking upstairs; for in R. Jones' circle it was recognized that\nnothing is a greater breach of etiquette and worse form than to\ntap people unexpectedly on the shoulder. That, it was felt,\nshould be left to those who are paid by the government to do it.\n\nR. Jones was about fifty years old, gray-haired, of a mauve\ncomplexion, jovial among his friends, and perhaps even more\njovial with chance acquaintances. It was estimated by envious",
        "intimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances, specially\nwith young men of the upper classes, with large purses and small\nforeheads--was worth hundreds of pounds a year to him. There was\nsomething about his comfortable appearance and his jolly manner\nthat irresistibly attracted a certain type of young man. It was\nhis good fortune that this type of young man should be the type\nfinancially most worth attracting.\n\nFreddie Threepwood had fallen under his spell during his short",
        "but crowded life in London. They had met for the first time at\nthe Derby; and ever since then R. Jones had held in Freddie's\nestimation that position of guide, philosopher and friend which\nhe held in the estimation of so many young men of Freddie's\nstamp.\n\nThat was why, at twelve o'clock punctually on this Spring day, he\ntapped with his cane on R. Jones' ground glass, and showed such\nsatisfaction and relief when the door was opened by the\nproprietor in person.",
        "\"Well, well, well!\" said R. Jones rollickingly. \"Whom have we\nhere? The dashing bridegroom-to-be, and no other!\"\n\nR. Jones, like Lord Emsworth, was delighted that Freddie was\nabout to marry a nice girl with plenty of money. The sudden\nturning off of the tap from which Freddie's allowance had flowed\nhad hit him hard. He had other sources of income, of course; but\nfew so easy and unfailing as Freddie had been in the days of his\nprosperity.",
        "\"The prodigal son, by George! Creeping back into the fold after\nall this weary time! It seems years since I saw you, Freddie.\nThe old gov'nor put his foot down--didn't he?--and stopped the\nfunds. Damned shame! I take it that things have loosened up a bit\nsince the engagement was announced--eh?\"\n\nFreddie sat down and chewed the knob of his cane unhappily.\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, Dickie, old top,\" he said, \"not so\nthat you could notice it, don't you know! Things are still pretty",
        "much the same. I managed to get away from Blandings for a night,\nbecause the gov'nor had to come to London; but I've got to go\nback with him on the three-o'clock train. And, as for money, I\ncan't get a quid out of him. As a matter of fact, I'm in the\ndeuce of a hole; and that's why I've come to you.\"\n\nEven fat, jovial men have their moments of depression. R. Jones'\nface clouded, and jerky remarks about hardness of times and\nlosses on the Stock Exchange began to proceed from him. As",
        "Scotland Yard had discovered, he lent money on occasion; but he\ndid not lend it to youths in Freddie's unfortunate position.\n\n\"Oh, I don't want to make a touch, you know,\" Freddie hastened to\nexplain. \"It isn't that. As a matter of fact, I managed to raise\nfive hundred of the best this morning. That ought to be enough.\"\n\n\"Depends on what you want it for,\" said R. Jones, magically genial\nonce more.\n\nThe thought entered his mind, as it had so often, that the world",
        "was full of easy marks. He wished he could meet the money-lender\nwho had been rash enough to advance the Honorable Freddie five\nhundred pounds. Those philanthropists cross our path too seldom.\n\nFreddie felt in his pocket, produced a cigarette case, and from\nit extracted a newspaper clipping.\n\n\"Did you read about poor old Percy in the papers? The case, you\nknow?\"\n\n\"Percy?\"\n\n\"Lord Stockheath, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Stockheath breach-of-promise case? I did more than that.",
        "I was in court all three days.\" R. Jones emitted a cozy chuckle.\n\"Is he a pal of yours? A cousin, eh? I wish you had seen him in\nthe witness box, with Jellicoe-Smith cross-examining him! The\nfunniest thing I ever heard! And his letters to the girl! They\nread them out in court; and of all--\"\n\n\"Don't, old man! Dickie, old top--please! I know all about it. I\nread the reports. They made poor old Percy look like an absolute\nass.\"\n\n\"Well, Nature had done that already; but I'm bound to say they",
        "improved on Nature's work. I should think your Cousin Percy must\nhave felt like a plucked chicken.\"\n\nA spasm of pain passed over the Honorable Freddie's vacant face.\nHe wriggled in his chair.\n\n\"Dickie, old man, I wish you wouldn't talk like that. It makes me\nfeel ill.\"\n\n\"Why, is he such a pal of yours as all that?\"\n\n\"It's not that. It's--the fact is, Dickie, old top, I'm in\nexactly the same bally hole as poor old Percy was, myself!\"\n\n\"What! You have been sued for breach of promise?\"",
        "\"Not absolutely that--yet. Look here; I'll tell you the whole\nthing. Do you remember a show at the Piccadilly about a year ago\ncalled \"The Baby Doll\"? There was a girl in the chorus.\"\n\n\"Several--I remember noticing.\"\n\n\"No; I mean one particular girl--a girl called Joan Valentine.\nThe rotten part is that I never met her.\"\n\n\"Pull yourself together, Freddie. What exactly is the trouble?\"\n\n\"Well--don't you see?--I used to go to the show every other",
        "night, and I fell frightfully in love with this girl--\"\n\n\"Without having met her?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, I was rather an ass in those days.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said R. Jones handsomely.\n\n\"I must have been or I shouldn't have been such an ass, don't you\nknow! Well, as I was saying, I used to write this girl letters,\nsaying how much I was in love with her; and--and--\"\n\n\"Specifically proposing marriage?\"\n\n\"I can't remember. I expect I did. I was awfully in love.\"\n\n\"How was that if you never met her?\"",
        "\"She wouldn't meet me. She wouldn't even come out to luncheon.\nShe didn't even answer my letters--just sent word down by the\nJohnny at the stage door. And then----\"\n\nFreddie's voice died away. He thrust the knob of his cane into\nhis mouth in a sort of frenzy.\n\n\"What then?\" inquired R. Jones.\n\nA scarlet blush manifested itself on Freddie's young face. His\neyes wandered sidewise. After a long pause a single word escaped\nhim, almost inaudible:\n\n\"Poetry!\"",
        "R. Jones trembled as though an electric current had been passed\nthrough his plump frame. His little eyes sparkled with merriment.\n\n\"You wrote her poetry!\"\n\n\"Yards of it, old boy--yards of it!\" groaned Freddie. Panic\nfilled him with speech. \"You see the frightful hole I'm in? This\ngirl is bound to have kept the letters. I don't remember whether\nI actually proposed to her or not; but anyway she's got enough\nmaterial to make it worth while to have a dash at an",
        "action--especially after poor old Percy has just got soaked for\nsuch a pile of money and made breach-of-promise cases the\nfashion, so to speak.\n\n\"And now that the announcement of my engagement is out she's\ncertain to get busy. Probably she has been waiting for something\nof the sort. Don't you see that all the cards are in her hands?\nWe couldn't afford to let the thing come into court. That poetry\nwould dish my marriage for a certainty. I'd have to emigrate or",
        "something! Goodness knows what would happen at home! My old\ngov'nor would murder me! So you see what a frightful hole I'm in,\ndon't you, Dickie, old man?\"\n\n\"And what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Why, to get hold of this girl and get back the letters--don't\nyou see? I can't do it myself, cooped up miles away in the\ncountry. And besides, I shouldn't know how to handle a thing\nlike that. It needs a chappie with a lot of sense and a\npersuasive sort of way with him.\"",
        "\"Thanks for the compliment, Freddie; but I should imagine that\nsomething a little more solid than a persuasive way would be\nrequired in a case like this. You said something a while ago\nabout five hundred pounds?\"\n\n\"Here it is, old man--in notes. I brought it on purpose. Will you\nreally take the thing on? Do you think you can work it for five\nhundred?\"\n\n\"I can have a try.\"\n\nFreddie rose, with an expression approximating to happiness on",
        "his face. Some men have the power of inspiring confidence in some\nof their fellows, though they fill others with distrust. Scotland\nYard might look askance at R. Jones, but to Freddie he was all\nthat was helpful and reliable. He shook R. Jones' hand several\ntimes in his emotion.\n\n\"That's absolutely topping of you, old man!\" he said. \"Then I'll\nleave the whole thing to you. Write me the moment you have done\nanything, won't you? Good-by, old top, and thanks ever so much!\"",
        "The door closed. R. Jones remained where he sat, his fingers\nstraying luxuriously among the crackling paper. A feeling of\ncomplete happiness warmed R. Jones' bosom. He was uncertain\nwhether or not his mission would be successful; and to be\ntruthful he was not letting that worry him much. What he was\ncertain of was the fact that the heavens had opened unexpectedly\nand dropped five hundred pounds into his lap.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth stood in the doorway of the Senior",
        "Conservative Club's vast diningroom, and beamed with a vague\nsweetness on the two hundred or so Senior Conservatives who, with\nmuch clattering of knives and forks, were keeping body and soul\ntogether by means of the coffee-room luncheon. He might have been\nposing for a statue of Amiability. His pale blue eyes shone with\na friendly light through their protecting glasses; the smile of a\nman at peace with all men curved his weak mouth; his bald head,",
        "reflecting the sunlight, seemed almost to wear a halo.\n\nNobody appeared to notice him. He so seldom came to London these\ndays that he was practically a stranger in the club; and in any\ncase your Senior Conservative, when at lunch, has little leisure\nfor observing anything not immediately on the table in front of\nhim. To attract attention in the dining-room of the Senior\nConservative Club between the hours of one and two-thirty, you\nhave to be a mutton chop--not an earl.",
        "It is possible that, lacking the initiative to make his way down\nthe long aisle and find a table for himself, he might have stood\nthere indefinitely, but for the restless activity of Adams, the\nhead steward. It was Adams' mission in life to flit to and fro,\nhauling would-be lunchers to their destinations, as a St. Bernard\ndog hauls travelers out of Alpine snowdrifts. He sighted Lord\nEmsworth and secured him with a genteel pounce.\n\n\"A table, your lordship? This way, your lordship.\" Adams",
        "remembered him, of course. Adams remembered everybody.\n\nLord Emsworth followed him beamingly and presently came to anchor\nat a table in the farther end of the room. Adams handed him the\nbill of fare and stood brooding over him like a providence.\n\n\"Don't often see your lordship in the club,\" he opened chattily.\n\nIt was business to know the tastes and dispositions of all the\nfive thousand or so members of the Senior Conservative Club and",
        "to suit his demeanor to them. To some he would hand the bill of\nfare swiftly, silently, almost brusquely, as one who realizes\nthat there are moments in life too serious for talk. Others, he\nknew, liked conversation; and to those he introduced the subject\nof food almost as a sub-motive.\n\nLord Emsworth, having examined the bill of fare with a mild\ncuriosity, laid it down and became conversational.\n\n\"No, Adams; I seldom visit London nowadays. London does not",
        "attract me. The country--the fields--the woods--the birds----\"\n\nSomething across the room seemed to attract his attention and his\nvoice trailed off. He inspected this for some time with bland\ninterest, then turned to Adams once more.\n\n\"What was I saying, Adams?\"\n\n\"The birds, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Birds! What birds? What about birds?\"\n\n\"You were speaking of the attractions of life in the country,\nyour lordship. You included the birds in your remarks.\"",
        "\"Oh, yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes, yes! Oh, yes--to be sure. Do you\never go to the country, Adams?\"\n\n\"Generally to the seashore, your lordship--when I take my annual\nvacation.\"\n\nWhatever was the attraction across the room once more exercised\nits spell. His lordship concentrated himself on it to the\nexclusion of all other mundane matters. Presently he came out of\nhis trance again.\n\n\"What were you saying, Adams?\"\n\n\"I said that I generally went to the seashore, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Eh? When?\"",
        "\"For my annual vacation, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Your what?\"\n\n\"My annual vacation, your lordship.\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\nAdams never smiled during business hours--unless professionally,\nas it were, when a member made a joke; but he was storing up in\nthe recesses of his highly respectable body a large laugh, to be\nshared with his wife when he reached home that night. Mrs. Adams\nnever wearied of hearing of the eccentricities of the members of",
        "the club. It occurred to Adams that he was in luck to-day. He was\nexpecting a little party of friends to supper that night, and he\nwas a man who loved an audience.\n\nYou would never have thought it, to look at him when engaged in\nhis professional duties, but Adams had built up a substantial\nreputation as a humorist in his circle by his imitations of\ncertain members of the club; and it was a matter of regret to him\nthat he got so few opportunities nowadays of studying the",
        "absent-minded Lord Emsworth. It was rare luck--his lordship\ncoming in to-day, evidently in his best form.\n\n\"Adams, who is the gentleman over by the window--the gentleman in\nthe brown suit?\"\n\n\"That is Mr. Simmonds, your lordship. He joined us last year.\"\n\n\"I never saw a man take such large mouthfuls. Did you ever see a\nman take such large mouthfuls, Adams?\"\n\nAdams refrained from expressing an opinion, but inwardly he was\nthrilling with artistic fervor. Mr. Simmonds eating, was one of",
        "his best imitations, though Mrs. Adams was inclined to object to\nit on the score that it was a bad example for the children. To be\nprivileged to witness Lord Emsworth watching and criticizing Mr.\nSimmonds was to collect material for a double-barreled character\nstudy that would assuredly make the hit of the evening.\n\n\"That man,\" went on Lord Emsworth, \"is digging his grave with his\nteeth. Digging his grave with his teeth, Adams! Do you take large\nmouthfuls, Adams?\"\n\n\"No, your lordship.\"",
        "\"Quite right. Very sensible of you, Adams--very sensible of you.\nVery sen---- What was I saying, Adams?\"\n\n\"About my not taking large mouthfuls, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Quite right--quite right! Never take large mouthfuls, Adams.\nNever gobble. Have you any children, Adams?\"\n\n\"Two, your lordship.\"\n\n\"I hope you teach them not to gobble. They pay for it in later\nlife. Americans gobble when young and ruin their digestions. My\nAmerican friend, Mr. Peters, suffers terribly from indigestion.\"",
        "Adams lowered his voice to a confidential murmur: \"If you will\npardon the liberty, your lordship--I saw it in the paper--\"\n\n\"About Mr. Peters' indigestion?\"\n\n\"About Miss Peters, your lordship, and the Honorable Frederick.\nMay I be permitted to offer my congratulations?\"\n\n\"Eh, Oh, yes--the engagement. Yes, yes, yes! Yes--to be sure.\nYes; very satisfactory in every respect. High time he settled\ndown and got a little sense. I put it to him straight. I cut off",
        "his allowance and made him stay at home. That made him\nthink--lazy young devil!\"\n\nLord Emsworth had his lucid moments; and in the one that occurred\nnow it came home to him that he was not talking to himself, as he\nhad imagined, but confiding intimate family secrets to the head\nsteward of his club's dining-room. He checked himself abruptly,\nand with a slight decrease of amiability fixed his gaze on the\nbill of fare and ordered cold beef. For an instant he felt",
        "resentful against Adams for luring him on to soliloquize; but the\nnext moment his whole mind was gripped by the fascinating\nspectacle of Mr. Simmonds dealing with a wedge of Stilton cheese,\nand Adams was forgotten.\n\nThe cold beef had the effect of restoring his lordship to\ncomplete amiability, and when Adams in the course of his\nwanderings again found himself at the table he was once more\ndisposed for light conversation.\n\n\"So you saw the news of the engagement in the paper, did you,\nAdams?\"",
        "\"Yes, your lordship, in the Mail. It had quite a long piece about\nit. And the Honorable Frederick's photograph and the young lady's\nwere in the Mirror. Mrs. Adams clipped them out and put them in\nan album, knowing that your lordship was a member of ours. If I\nmay say so, your lordship--a beautiful young lady.\"\n\n\"Devilish attractive, Adams--and devilish rich. Mr. Peters is a\nmillionaire, Adams.\"\n\n\"So I read in the paper, your lordship.\"",
        "\"Damme! They all seem to be millionaires in America. Wish I knew\nhow they managed it. Honestly, I hope. Mr. Peters is an honest\nman, but his digestion is bad. He used to bolt his food. You\ndon't bolt your food, I hope, Adams?\"\n\n\"No, your lordship; I am most careful.\"\n\n\"The late Mr. Gladstone used to chew each mouthful thirty-three\ntimes. Deuced good notion if you aren't in a hurry. What cheese\nwould you recommend, Adams?\"\n\n\"The gentlemen are speaking well of the Gorgonzola.\"",
        "\"All right, bring me some. You know, Adams, what I admire about\nAmericans is their resource. Mr. Peters tells me that as a boy of\neleven he earned twenty dollars a week selling mint to saloon\nkeepers, as they call publicans over there. Why they wanted mint\nI cannot recollect. Mr. Peters explained the reason to me and it\nseemed highly plausible at the time; but I have forgotten it.\nPossibly for mint sauce. It impressed me, Adams. Twenty dollars",
        "is four pounds. I never earned four pounds a week when I was a\nboy of eleven; in fact, I don't think I ever earned four pounds a\nweek. His story impressed me, Adams. Every man ought to have an\nearning capacity. I was so struck with what he told me that I\nbegan to paint.\"\n\n\"Landscapes, your lordship?\"\n\n\"Furniture. It is unlikely that I shall ever be compelled to\npaint furniture for a living, but it is a consolation to me to\nfeel that I could do so if called on. There is a fascination",
        "about painting furniture, Adams. I have painted the whole of my\nbedroom at Blandings and am now engaged on the museum. You would\nbe surprised at the fascination of it. It suddenly came back to\nme the other day that I had been inwardly longing to mess about\nwith paints and things since I was a boy. They stopped me when I\nwas a boy. I recollect my old father beating me with a walking\nstick--Tell me, Adams, have I eaten my cheese?\"\n\n\"Not yet, your lordship. I was about to send the waiter for it.\"",
        "\"Never mind. Tell him to bring the bill instead. I remember that\nI have an appointment. I must not be late.\"\n\n\"Shall I take the fork, your lordship?\"\n\n\"The fork?\"\n\n\"Your lordship has inadvertently put a fork in your coat pocket.\"\n\nLord Emsworth felt in the pocket indicated, and with the air of\nan inexpert conjurer whose trick has succeeded contrary to his\nexpectations produced a silver-plated fork. He regarded it with\nsurprise; then he looked wonderingly at Adams.",
        "\"Adams, I'm getting absent-minded. Have you ever noticed any\ntraces of absent-mindedness in me before?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, it's deuced peculiar! I have no recollection whatsoever of\nplacing that fork in my pocket . . . Adams, I want a taxicab.\" He\nglanced round the room, as though expecting to locate one by the\nfireplace.\n\n\"The hall porter will whistle one for you, your lordship.\"\n\n\"So he will, by George!--so he will! Good day, Adams.\"\n\n\"Good day, your lordship.\"",
        "The Earl of Emsworth ambled benevolently to the door, leaving\nAdams with the feeling that his day had been well-spent. He gazed\nalmost with reverence after the slow-moving figure.\n\n\"What a nut!\" said Adams to his immortal soul.\n\nWafted through the sunlit streets in his taxicab, the Earl of\nEmsworth smiled benevolently on London's teeming millions. He was\nas completely happy as only a fluffy-minded old man with\nexcellent health and a large income can be. Other people worried",
        "about all sorts of things--strikes, wars, suffragettes, the\ndiminishing birth rate, the growing materialism of the age, a\nscore of similar subjects.\n\nWorrying, indeed, seemed to be the twentieth-century specialty.\nLord Emsworth never worried. Nature had equipped him with a mind\nso admirably constructed for withstanding the disagreeableness of\nlife that if an unpleasant thought entered it, it passed out\nagain a moment later. Except for a few of life's fundamental",
        "facts, such as that his check book was in the right-hand top\ndrawer of his desk; that the Honorable Freddie Threepwood was a\nyoung idiot who required perpetual restraint; and that when in\ndoubt about anything he had merely to apply to his secretary,\nRupert Baxter--except for these basic things, he never remembered\nanything for more than a few minutes.\n\nAt Eton, in the sixties, they had called him Fathead.\n\nHis was a life that lacked, perhaps, the sublimer emotions which",
        "raise man to the level of the gods; but undeniably it was an\nextremely happy one. He never experienced the thrill of ambition\nfulfilled; but, on the other hand, he never knew the agony of\nambition frustrated. His name, when he died, would not live\nforever in England's annals; he was spared the pain of worrying\nabout this by the fact that he had no desire to live forever in\nEngland's annals. He was possibly as nearly contented as a human\nbeing could be in this century of alarms and excursions.",
        "Indeed, as he bowled along in his cab and reflected that a really\ncharming girl, not in the chorus of any West End theater, a girl\nwith plenty of money and excellent breeding, had--in a moment,\ndoubtless, of mental aberration--become engaged to be married to\nthe Honorable Freddie, he told himself that life at last was\nabsolutely without a crumpled rose leaf.\n\nThe cab drew up before a house gay with flowered window boxes.\nLord Emsworth paid the driver and stood on the sidewalk looking",
        "up at this cheerful house, trying to remember why on earth he had\ntold the man to drive there.\n\nA few moments' steady thought gave him the answer to the riddle.\nThis was Mr. Peters' town house, and he had come to it by\ninvitation to look at Mr. Peters' collection of scarabs. To be\nsure! He remembered now--his collection of scarabs. Or was it\nArabs?\n\nLord Emsworth smiled. Scarabs, of course. You couldn't collect\nArabs. He wondered idly, as he rang the bell, what scarabs might",
        "be; but he was interested in a fluffy kind of way in all forms of\ncollecting, and he was very pleased to have the opportunity of\nexamining these objects; whatever they were. He rather thought\nthey were a kind of fish.\n\nThere are men in this world who cannot rest; who are so\nconstituted that they can only take their leisure in the shape of\na change of work. To this fairly numerous class belonged Mr. J.\nPreston Peters, father of Freddie's Aline. And to this merit--or",
        "defect--is to be attributed his almost maniacal devotion to that\nrather unattractive species of curio, the Egyptian scarab.\n\nFive years before, a nervous breakdown had sent Mr. Peters to a\nNew York specialist. The specialist had grown rich on similar\ncases and his advice was always the same. He insisted on Mr.\nPeters taking up a hobby.\n\n\"What sort of a hobby?\" inquired Mr. Peters irritably. His\ndigestion had just begun to trouble him at the time, and his\ntemper now was not of the best.",
        "\"Now my hobby,\" said the specialist, \"is the collecting of\nscarabs. Why should you not collect scarabs?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Mr. Peters, \"I shouldn't know one if you brought\nit to me on a plate. What are scarabs?\"\n\n\"Scarabs,\" said the specialist, warming to his subject, \"the\nEgyptian hieroglyphs.\"\n\n\"And what,\" inquired Mr. Peters, \"are Egyptian hieroglyphs?\"\n\nThe specialist began to wonder whether it would not have been\nbetter to advise Mr. Peters to collect postage stamps.",
        "\"A scarab,\" he said--\"derived from the Latin scarabeus--is\nliterally a beetle.\"\n\n\"I will not collect beetles!\" said Mr. Peters definitely. \"They\ngive me the Willies.\"\n\n\"Scarabs are Egyptian symbols in the form of beetles,\" the\nspecialist hurried on. \"The most common form of scarab is in the\nshape of a ring. Scarabs were used for seals. They were also\nemployed as beads or ornaments. Some scarabaei bear inscriptions\nhaving reference to places; as, for instance: 'Memphis is mighty\nforever.'\"",
        "Mr. Peters' scorn changed to active interest.\n\n\"Have you got one like that?\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"A scarab boosting Memphis. It's my home town.\"\n\n\"I think it possible that some other Memphis was alluded to.\"\n\n\"There isn't any other except the one in Tennessee,\" said Mr.\nPeters patriotically.\n\nThe specialist owed the fact that he was a nerve doctor instead\nof a nerve patient to his habit of never arguing with his\nvisitors.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, \"you would care to glance at my collection.",
        "It is in the next room.\"\n\nThat was the beginning of Mr. Peters' devotion to scarabs. At\nfirst he did his collecting without any love of it, partly\nbecause he had to collect something or suffer, but principally\nbecause of a remark the specialist made as he was leaving the\nroom.\n\n\"How long would it take me to get together that number of the\nthings?\" Mr. Peters inquired, when, having looked his fill on the\ndullest assortment of objects he remembered ever to have seen, he",
        "was preparing to take his leave.\n\nThe specialist was proud of his collection. \"How long? To make a\ncollection as large as mine? Years, Mr. Peters. Oh, many, many\nyears.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you a hundred dollars I'll do it in six months!\"\n\nFrom that moment Mr. Peters brought to the collecting of scarabs\nthe same furious energy which had given him so many dollars and\nso much indigestion. He went after scarabs like a dog after rats.\nHe scooped in scarabs from the four corners of the earth, until",
        "at the end of a year he found himself possessed of what, purely\nas regarded quantity, was a record collection.\n\nThis marked the end of the first phase of--so to speak--the\nscarabaean side of his life. Collecting had become a habit with\nhim, but he was not yet a real enthusiast. It occurred to him\nthat the time had arrived for a certain amount of pruning and\nelimination. He called in an expert and bade him go through the\ncollection and weed out what he felicitously termed the \"dead",
        "ones.\" The expert did his job thoroughly. When he had finished,\nthe collection was reduced to a mere dozen specimens.\n\n\"The rest,\" he explained, \"are practically valueless. If you are\nthinking of making a collection that will have any value in the\neyes of archeologists I should advise you to throw them away. The\nremaining twelve are good.\"\n\n\"How do you mean--good? Why is one of these things valuable and\nanother so much punk? They all look alike to me.\"",
        "And then the expert talked to Mr. Peters for nearly two hours\nabout the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, Osiris, Ammon, Mut,\nBubastis, dynasties, Cheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels,\nAmenophis III, Queen Taia, the Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the\nlake of Zarukhe, Naucratis, and the Book of the Dead. He did it\nwith a relish. He liked to do it.\n\nWhen he had finished, Mr. Peters thanked him and went to the\nbathroom, where he bathed his temples with eau de Cologne.",
        "That talk changed J. Preston Peters from a supercilious\nscooper-up of random scarabs to what might be called a genuine\nscarab fan. It does not matter what a man collects; if Nature has\ngiven him the collector's mind he will become a fanatic on the\nsubject of whatever collection he sets out to make. Mr. Peters\nhad collected dollars; he began to collect scarabs with precisely\nthe same enthusiasm. He would have become just as enthusiastic",
        "about butterflies or old china if he had turned his thoughts to\nthem; but it chanced that what he had taken up was the collecting\nof the scarab, and it gripped him more and more as the years went\non.\n\nGradually he came to love his scarabs with that love, surpassing\nthe love of women, which only collectors know. He became an\nexpert on those curious relics of a dead civilization. For a time\nthey ran neck and neck in his thoughts with business. When he",
        "retired from business he was free to make them the master passion\nof his life. He treasured each individual scarab in his\ncollection as a miser treasures gold.\n\nCollecting, as Mr. Peters did it, resembles the drink habit. It\nbegins as an amusement and ends as an obsession. He was gloating\nover his treasures when the maid announced Lord Emsworth.\n\nA curious species of mutual toleration--it could hardly be\ndignified by the title of friendship--had sprung up between these",
        "two men, so opposite in practically every respect. Each regarded\nthe other with that feeling of perpetual amazement with which we\nencounter those whose whole viewpoint and mode of life is foreign\nto our own.\n\nThe American's force and nervous energy fascinated Lord Emsworth.\nAs for Mr. Peters, nothing like the earl had ever happened to him\nbefore in a long and varied life. Each, in fact, was to the other\na perpetual freak show, with no charge for admission. And if",
        "anything had been needed to cement the alliance it would have\nbeen supplied by the fact that they were both collectors.\n\nThey differed in collecting as they did in everything else. Mr.\nPeters' collecting, as has been shown, was keen, furious,\nconcentrated; Lord Emsworth's had the amiable dodderingness that\nmarked every branch of his life. In the museum at Blandings\nCastle you could find every manner of valuable and valueless\ncurio. There was no central motive; the place was simply an",
        "amateur junk shop. Side by side with a Gutenberg Bible for which\nrival collectors would have bidden without a limit, you would\ncome on a bullet from the field of Waterloo, one of a consignment\nof ten thousand shipped there for the use of tourists by a\nBirmingham firm. Each was equally attractive to its owner.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Peters,\" said Lord Emsworth sunnily, advancing into\nthe room, \"I trust I am not unpunctual. I have been lunching at\nmy club.\"",
        "\"I'd have asked you to lunch here,\" said Mr. Peters, \"but you\nknow how it is with me . . . I've promised the doctor I'll give\nthose nuts and grasses of his a fair trial, and I can do it\npretty well when I'm alone with Aline; but to have to sit by and\nsee somebody else eating real food would be trying me too high.\"\n\nLord Emsworth murmured sympathetically. The other's digestive\ntribulations touched a ready chord. An excellent trencherman\nhimself, he understood what Mr. Peters must suffer.",
        "\"Too bad!\" he said.\n\nMr. Peters turned the conversation into other channels.\n\n\"These are my scarabs,\" he said.\n\nLord Emsworth adjusted his glasses, and the mild smile\ndisappeared from his face, to be succeeded by a set look. A stage\ndirector of a moving-picture firm would have recognized the look.\nLord Emsworth was registering interest--interest which he\nperceived from the first instant would have to be completely\nsimulated; for instinct told him, as Mr. Peters began to talk,",
        "that he was about to be bored as he had seldom been bored in his\nlife.\n\nMr. Peters, in his character of showman, threw himself into his\nwork with even more than his customary energy. His flow of speech\nnever faltered. He spoke of the New Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom,\nOsiris and Ammon; waxed eloquent concerning Mut, Bubastis,\nCheops, the Hyksos kings, cylinders, bezels and Amenophis III;\nand became at times almost lyrical when touching on Queen Taia,",
        "the Princess Gilukhipa of Mitanni, the lake of Zarukhe, Naucratis\nand the Book of the Dead. Time slid by.\n\n\"Take a look at this, Lord Emsworth.\"\n\nAs one who, brooding on love or running over business projects in\nhis mind, walks briskly into a lamppost and comes back to the\nrealities of life with a sense of jarring shock, Lord Emsworth\nstarted, blinked and returned to consciousness. Far away his mind\nhad been--seventy miles away--in the pleasant hothouses and shady",
        "garden walks of Blandings Castle. He came back to London to find\nthat his host, with a mingled air of pride and reverence, was\nextending toward him a small, dingy-looking something.\n\nHe took it and looked at it. That, apparently, was what he was\nmeant to do. So far, all was well.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said--that blessed word; covering everything! He\nrepeated it, pleased at his ready resource.\n\n\"A Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty,\" said Mr. Peters fervently.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"",
        "\"A Cheops--of the Fourth Dynasty.\"\n\nLord Emsworth began to feel like a hunted stag. He could not go\non saying \"Ah!\" indefinitely; yet what else was there to say to\nthis curious little beastly sort of a beetle kind of thing?\n\n\"Dear me! A Cheops!\"\n\n\"Of the Fourth Dynasty!\"\n\n\"Bless my soul! The Fourth Dynasty!\"\n\n\"What do you think of that--eh?\"\n\nStrictly speaking, Lord Emsworth thought nothing of it; and he\nwas wondering how to veil this opinion in diplomatic words, when",
        "the providence that looks after all good men saved him by causing\na knock at the door to occur. In response to Mr. Peters'\nirritated cry a maid entered.\n\n\"If you please, sir, Mr. Threepwood wishes to speak with you on\nthe telephone.\"\n\nMr. Peters turned to his guest. \"Excuse me for one moment.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Lord Emsworth gratefully. \"Certainly,\ncertainly, certainly! By all means.\"\n\nThe door closed behind Mr. Peters. Lord Emsworth was alone. For",
        "some moments he stood where he had been left, a figure with small\nsigns of alertness about it. But Mr. Peters did not return\nimmediately. The booming of his voice came faintly from some\ndistant region. Lord Emsworth strolled to the window and looked\nout.\n\nThe sun still shone brightly on the quiet street. Across the road\nwere trees. Lord Emsworth was fond of trees; he looked at these\napprovingly. Then round the corner came a vagrom man, wheeling\nflowers in a barrow.",
        "Flowers! Lord Emsworth's mind shot back to Blandings like a\nhoming pigeon. Flowers! Had he or had he not given Head Gardener\nThorne adequate instructions as to what to do with those\nhydrangeas? Assuming that he had not, was Thorne to be depended\non to do the right thing by them by the light of his own\nintelligence? Lord Emsworth began to brood on Head Gardener\nThorne.\n\nHe was aware of some curious little object in his hand. He\naccorded it a momentary inspection. It had no message for him.",
        "It was probably something; but he could not remember what. He put\nit in his pocket and returned to his meditations.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAt about the hour when the Earl of Emsworth was driving to keep\nhis appointment with Mr. Peters, a party of two sat at a corner\ntable at Simpson's Restaurant, in the Strand. One of the two was\na small, pretty, good-natured-looking girl of about twenty; the\nother, a thick-set young man, with a wiry crop of red-brown hair",
        "and an expression of mingled devotion and determination. The girl\nwas Aline Peters; the young man's name was George Emerson. He,\nalso, was an American, a rising member in a New York law firm. He\nhad a strong, square face, with a dogged and persevering chin.\n\nThere are all sorts of restaurants in London, from the restaurant\nwhich makes you fancy you are in Paris to the restaurant which\nmakes you wish you were. There are palaces in Piccadilly, quaint",
        "lethal chambers in Soho, and strange food factories in Oxford\nStreet and Tottenham Court Road. There are restaurants which\nspecialize in ptomaine and restaurants which specialize in\nsinister vegetable messes. But there is only one Simpson's.\n\nSimpson's, in the Strand, is unique. Here, if he wishes, the\nBriton may for the small sum of half a dollar stupefy himself\nwith food. The god of fatted plenty has the place under his\nprotection. Its keynote is solid comfort.",
        "It is a pleasant, soothing, hearty place--a restful temple of\nfood. No strident orchestra forces the diner to bolt beef in\nragtime. No long central aisle distracts his attention with its\nstream of new arrivals. There he sits, alone with his food, while\nwhite-robed priests, wheeling their smoking trucks, move to and\nfro, ever ready with fresh supplies.\n\nAll round the room--some at small tables, some at large tables\n--the worshipers sit, in their eyes that resolute, concentrated",
        "look which is the peculiar property of the British luncher,\nex-President Roosevelt's man-eating fish, and the American army\nworm.\n\nConversation does not flourish at Simpson's. Only two of all\nthose present on this occasion showed any disposition toward\nchattiness. They were Aline Peters and her escort.\n\n\"The girl you ought to marry,\" Aline was saying, \"is Joan\nValentine.\"\n\n\"The girl I am going to marry,\" said George Emerson, \"is Aline\nPeters.\"",
        "For answer, Aline picked up from the floor beside her an\nillustrated paper and, having opened it at a page toward the end,\nhanded it across the table.\n\nGeorge Emerson glanced at it disdainfully. There were two\nphotographs on the page. One was of Aline; the other of a heavy,\nloutish-looking youth, who wore that expression of pained\nglassiness which Young England always adopts in the face of a\ncamera.\n\nUnder one photograph were printed the words: \"Miss Aline Peters,",
        "who is to marry the Honorable Frederick Threepwood in June\";\nunder the other: \"The Honorable Frederick Threepwood, who is to\nmarry Miss Aline Peters in June.\" Above the photographs was the\nlegend: \"Forthcoming International Wedding. Son of the Earl of\nEmsworth to marry American heiress.\" In one corner of the picture\na Cupid, draped in the Stars and Stripes, aimed his bow at the\ngentleman; in the other another Cupid, clad in a natty Union\nJack, was drawing a bead on the lady.",
        "The subeditor had done his work well. He had not been ambiguous.\nWhat he intended to convey to the reader was that Miss Aline\nPeters, of America, was going to marry the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood, son of the Earl of Emsworth; and that was exactly the\nimpression the average reader got.\n\nGeorge Emerson, however, was not an average reader. The\nsubeditor's work did not impress him.\n\n\"You mustn't believe everything you see in the papers,\" he said.",
        "\"What are the stout children in the one-piece bathing suits\nsupposed to be doing?\"\n\n\"Those are Cupids, George, aiming at us with their little bow--\na pretty and original idea.\"\n\n\"Why Cupids?\"\n\n\"Cupid is the god of love.\"\n\n\"What has the god of love got to do with it?\"\n\nAline placidly devoured a fried potato. \"You're simply trying to\nmake me angry,\" she said; \"and I call it very mean of you. You\nknow perfectly well how fatal it is to get angry at meals. It was",
        "eating while he was in a bad temper that ruined father's\ndigestion. George, that nice, fat carver is wheeling his truck\nthis way. Flag him and make him give me some more of that\nmutton.\"\n\nGeorge looked round him morosely.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"is England--this restaurant, I mean. You don't\nneed to go any farther. Just take a good look at this place and\nyou have seen the whole country and can go home again. You may\njudge a country by its meals. A people with imagination will eat",
        "with imagination. Look at the French; look at ourselves. The\nEnglishman loathes imagination. He goes to a place like this and\nsays: 'Don't bother me to think. Here's half a dollar. Give me\nfood--any sort of food--until I tell you to stop.' And that's the\nprinciple on which he lives his life. 'Give me anything, and\ndon't bother me!' That's his motto.\"\n\n\"If that was meant to apply to Freddie and me, I think you're\nvery rude. Do you mean that any girl would have done for him, so",
        "long as it was a girl?\"\n\nGeorge Emerson showed a trace of confusion. Being honest with\nhimself, he had to admit that he did not exactly know what he did\nmean--if he meant anything. That, he felt rather bitterly, was\nthe worst of Aline. She would never let a fellow's good things go\npurely as good things; she probed and questioned and spoiled the\nwhole effect. He was quite sure that when he began to speak he\nhad meant something, but what it was escaped him for the moment.",
        "He had been urged to the homily by the fact that at a neighboring\ntable he had caught sight of a stout young Briton, with a red\nface, who reminded him of the Honorable Frederick Threepwood. He\nmentioned this to Aline.\n\n\"Do you see that fellow in the gray suit--I think he has been\nsleeping in it--at the table on your right? Look at the stodgy\nface. See the glassy eye. If that man sandbagged your Freddie and\ntied him up somewhere, and turned up at the church instead of",
        "him, can you honestly tell me you would know the difference?\nCome, now, wouldn't you simply say, 'Why, Freddie, how natural\nyou look!' and go through the ceremony without a suspicion?\"\n\n\"He isn't a bit like Freddie.\"\n\n\"My dear girl, there isn't a man in this restaurant under the age\nof thirty who isn't just like Freddie. All Englishmen look\nexactly alike, talk exactly alike, and think exactly alike.\"\n\n\"And you oughtn't to speak of him as Freddie. You don't know\nhim.\"",
        "\"Yes, I do. And, what is more, he expressly asked me to call him\nFreddie. 'Oh, dash it, old top, don't keep on calling me\nThreepwood! Freddie to pals!' Those were his very words.\"\n\n\"George, you're making this up.\"\n\n\"Not at all. We met last night at the National Sporting Club.\nPorky Jones was going twenty rounds with Eddie Flynn. I offered\nto give three to one on Eddie. Freddie, who was sitting next to\nme, took me in fivers. And if you want any further proof of your",

My own home town!\"\n\n\"Did your Eddie win?\"\n\n\"You don't listen--I told you he was from Pittsburgh. And\nafterward Threepwood chummed up with me and told me that to real\npals like me he was Freddie. I was a real pal, as I understood\nit, because I would have to wait for my money. The fact was, he\nexplained, his old governor had cut off his bally allowance.\"",
        "\"You're simply trying to poison my mind against him; and I don't\nthink it's very nice of you, George.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--poison your mind? I'm not poisoning your mind;\nI'm simply telling you a few things about him. You know perfectly\nwell that you don't love him, and that you aren't going to marry\nhim--and that you are going to marry me.\"\n\n\"How do you know I don't love my Freddie?\"\n\n\"If you can look me straight in the eyes and tell me you do, I",

Now, then!\"\n\n\"And all the while you're talking you're letting my carver get\naway,\" said Aline.\n\nGeorge called to the willing priest, who steered his truck toward\nthem. Aline directed his dissection of the shoulder of mutton by\nword and gesture.\n\n\"Enjoy yourself!\" said Emerson coldly.\n\n\"So I do, George; so I do. What excellent meat they have in\nEngland!\"",
        "\"It all comes from America,\" said George patriotically. \"And,\nanyway, can't you be a bit more spiritual? I don't want to sit\nhere discussing food products.\"\n\n\"If you were in my position, George, you wouldn't want to talk\nabout anything else. It's doing him a world of good, poor dear;\nbut there are times when I'm sorry Father ever started this\nfood-reform thing. You don't know what it means for a healthy\nyoung girl to try and support life on nuts and grasses.\"",
        "\"And why should you?\" broke out Emerson. \"I'll tell you what it\nis, Aline--you are perfectly absurd about your father. I don't\nwant to say anything against him to you, naturally; but--\"\n\n\"Go ahead, George. Why this diffidence? Say what you like.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I will. I'll give it to you straight. You know\nquite well that you have let your father bully you since you were\nin short frocks. I don't say it is your fault or his fault, or",

        "yesterday, and she is just the same. She has been through the\nmost awful times. Her father was quite rich; he died suddenly\nwhile he and Joan were in Paris, and she found that he hadn't\nleft a cent. He had been living right up to his income all the\ntime. His life wasn't even insured. She came to London; and, so\nfar as I could make out from the short talk we had, she has done\npretty nearly everything since we last met. She worked in a shop",
        "and went on the stage, and all sorts of things. Isn't it awful,\nGeorge!\"\n\n\"Pretty tough,\" said Emerson. He was but faintly interested in\nMiss Valentine.\n\n\"She is so plucky and full of life. She would stand up to you.\"\n\n\"Thanks! My idea of marriage is not a perpetual scrap.

        "*   *   *\n\nIt was Aline Peters who had to bear the brunt of her father's\nmental agony when he discovered, shortly after Lord Emsworth had\nleft him, that the gem of his collection of scarabs had done the\nsame. It is always the innocent bystander who suffers.\n\n\"The darned old sneak thief!\" said Mr. Peters.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"Don't sit there saying 'Father!' What's the use of saying\n'Father!'? Do you think it is going to help--your saying",
        "'Father!'? I'd rather the old pirate had taken the house and lot\nthan that scarab. He knows what's what! Trust him to walk off\nwith the pick of the whole bunch! I did think I could leave the\nfather of the man who's going to marry my daughter for a second\nalone with the things. There's no morality among\ncollectors--none!

I'm sure he didn't mean to steal\nthe scarab.\"\n\nMr. Peters' overwrought soul blew off steam in the shape of a\npassionate snort.\n\n\"Didn't mean to steal it! What do you think he meant to do--take\nit away and keep it safe for me for fear I should lose it? Didn't\nmean to steal it! Bet you he's well-known in society as a\nkleptomaniac.

That's the trouble with you,\" said Mr.\nPeters.\n\nYears of indigestion had made Mr. Peters' temper, even when in a\nnormal mood, perfectly impossible; in a crisis like this it ran\namuck. He vented it on Aline because he had always vented his\nirritabilities on Aline; because the fact of her sweet, gentle",
        "disposition, combined with the fact of their relationship, made\nher the ideal person to receive the overflow of his black moods.\nWhile his wife had lived he had bullied her. On her death Aline\nhad stepped into the vacant position.\n\nAline did not cry, because she was not a girl who was given to\ntears; but, for all her placid good temper, she was wounded. She\nwas a girl who liked everything in the world to run smoothly and\neasily, and these scenes with her father always depressed her.",
        "She took advantage of a lull in Mr. Peters' flow of words and\nslipped from the room.\n\nHer cheerfulness had received a shock. She wanted sympathy. She\nwanted comforting. For a moment she considered George Emerson in\nthe role of comforter; but there were objections to George in\nthis character. Aline was accustomed to tease and chat with\nGeorge, but at heart she was a little afraid of him; and instinct\ntold her that, as comforter, he would be too volcanic and",
        "supermanly for a girl who was engaged to marry another man in\nJune. George, as comforter, would be far too prone to trust to\naction rather than to the soothing power of the spoken word.\nGeorge's idea of healing the wound, she felt, would be to push\nher into a cab and drive to the nearest registrar's.\n\nNo; she would not go to George. To whom, then? The vision of Joan\nValentine came to her--of Joan as she had seen her yesterday,\nstrong, cheerful, self-reliant, bearing herself, in spite of",
        "adversity, with a valiant jauntiness. Yes; she would go and see\nJoan. She put on her hat and stole from the house.\n\nCuriously enough, only a quarter of an hour before, R.

In the big chair nearest the door",
        "the Honorable Frederick Threepwood--Freddie to pals--was reading.\nNext to him sat a young man whose eyes, glittering through\nrimless spectacles, were concentrated on the upturned faces of\nseveral neat rows of playing cards--Rupert Baxter, Lord\nEmsworth's invaluable secretary, had no vices, but he sometimes\nrelaxed his busy brain with a game of solitaire. Beyond Baxter, a\ncigar in his mouth and a weak highball at his side, the Earl of\nEmsworth took his ease.",
        "The book the Honorable Freddie was reading was a small\npaper-covered book. Its cover was decorated with a color scheme\nin red, black and yellow, depicting a tense moment in the lives\nof a man with a black beard, a man with a yellow beard, a man\nwithout any beard at all, and a young woman who, at first sight,\nappeared to be all eyes and hair. The man with the black beard,\nto gain some private end, had tied this young woman with ropes to",
        "a complicated system of machinery, mostly wheels and pulleys. The\nman with the yellow beard was in the act of pushing or pulling a\nlever. The beardless man, protruding through a trapdoor in the\nfloor, was pointing a large revolver at the parties of the second\npart.\n\nBeneath this picture were the words: \"Hands up, you scoundrels!\"\n\nAbove it, in a meandering scroll across the page, was: \"Gridley\nQuayle, Investigator. The Adventure of the Secret Six. By Felix\nClovelly.\"",
        "The Honorable Freddie did not so much read as gulp the adventure\nof the Secret Six. His face was crimson with excitement; his hair\nwas rumpled; his eyes bulged. He was absorbed.\n\nThis is peculiarly an age in which each of us may, if we do but\nsearch diligently, find the literature suited to his mental\npowers. Grave and earnest men, at Eton and elsewhere, had tried\nFreddie Threepwood with Greek, with Latin and with English; and\nthe sheeplike stolidity with which he declined to be interested",
        "in the masterpieces of all three tongues had left them with the\nconviction that he would never read anything.\n\nAnd then, years afterward, he had suddenly blossomed out as a\nstudent--only, it is true, a student of the Adventures of Gridley\nQuayle; but still a student. His was a dull life and Gridley\nQuayle was the only person who brought romance into it. Existence\nfor the Honorable Freddie was simply a sort of desert, punctuated\nwith monthly oases in the shape of new Quayle adventures. It was",
        "his ambition to meet the man who wrote them.\n\nLord Emsworth sat and smoked, and sipped and smoked again, at\npeace with all the world. His mind was as nearly a blank as it is\npossible for the human mind to be. The hand that had not the task\nof holding the cigar was at rest in his trousers pocket. The\nfingers of it fumbled idly with a small, hard object.\n\nGradually it filtered into his lordship's mind that this small,\nhard object was not familiar. It was something new--something",
        "that was neither his keys nor his pencil; nor was it his small\nchange. He yielded to a growing curiosity and drew it out. He\nexamined it. It was a little something, rather like a fossilized\nbeetle. It touched no chord in him. He looked at it with amiable\ndistaste.\n\n\"Now how in the world did that get there?\" he said.\n\nThe Honorable Freddie paid no attention to the remark. He was now\nat the very crest of his story, when every line intensified the",
        "thrill. Incident was succeeding incident. The Secret Six were\nhere, there and everywhere, like so many malignant June bugs.\n\nAnnabel, the heroine, was having a perfectly rotten\ntime--kidnapped, and imprisoned every few minutes. Gridley\nQuayle, hot on the scent, was covering somebody or other with his\nrevolver almost continuously. Freddie Threepwood had no time for\nchatting with his father. Not so Rupert Baxter. Chatting with\nLord Emsworth was one of the things for which he received his",
        "salary. He looked up from his cards.\n\n\"Lord Emsworth?\"\n\n\"I have found a curious object in my pocket, Baxter. I was\nwondering how it got there.\"\n\nHe handed the thing to his secretary. Rupert Baxter's eyes lit up\nwith sudden enthusiasm. He gasped.\n\n\"Magnificent!\" he cried. \"Superb!\"\n\nLord Emsworth looked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"It is a scarab, Lord Emsworth; and unless I am mistaken--and I\nthink I may claim to be something of an expert--a Cheops of the",
        "Fourth Dynasty. A wonderful addition to your museum!\"\n\n\"Is it? By Gad! You don't say so, Baxter!\"\n\n\"It is, indeed. If it is not a rude question, how much did you\ngive for it, Lord Emsworth? It must have been the gem of\nsomebody's collection. Was there a sale at Christie's this\nafternoon?\"\n\nLord Emsworth shook his head. \"I did not get it at Christie's,\nfor I recollect that I had an important engagement which\nprevented my going to Christie's. To be sure; yes--I had promised",
        "to call on Mr. Peters and examine his collection of--Now I wonder\nwhat it was that Mr. Peters said he collected!\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters is one of the best-known living collectors of\nscarabs.\"\n\n\"Scarabs! You are quite right, Baxter. Now that I recall the\nepisode, this is a scarab; and Mr. Peters gave it to me.\"\n\n\"Gave it to you, Lord Emsworth?\"\n\n\"Yes. The whole scene comes back to me. Mr. Peters, after telling\nme a great many exceedingly interesting things about scarabs,",
        "which I regret to say I cannot remember, gave me this. And you\nsay it is really valuable, Baxter?\"\n\n\"It is, from a collector's point of view, of extraordinary\nvalue.\"\n\n\"Bless my soul!\" Lord Emsworth beamed. \"This is extremely\ninteresting, Baxter. One has heard so much of the princely\nhospitality of Americans. How exceedingly kind of Mr. Peters! I\nshall certainly treasure it, though I must confess that from a\npurely spectacular standpoint it leaves me a little cold.",
        "However, I must not look a gift horse in the mouth--eh, Baxter?\"\n\nFrom afar came the silver booming of a gong. Lord Emsworth rose.\n\n\"Time to dress for dinner? I had no idea it was so late. Baxter,\nyou will be going past the museum door. Will you be a good fellow\nand place this among the exhibits? You will know what to do with\nit better than I. I always think of you as the curator of my\nlittle collection, Baxter--ha-ha! Mind how you step when you are",
        "in the museum. I was painting a chair there yesterday and I think\nI left the paint pot on the floor.\"\n\nHe cast a less amiable glance at his studious son.\n\n\"Get up, Frederick, and go and dress for dinner. What is that\ntrash you are reading?\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie came out of his book much as a sleepwalker\nwakes--with a sense of having been violently assaulted. He looked\nup with a kind of stunned plaintiveness.\n\n\"Eh, gov'nor?\"\n\n\"Make haste! Beach rang the gong five minutes ago. What is that",
        "you are reading?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, gov'nor--just a book.\"\n\n\"I wonder you can waste your time on such trash. Make haste!\"\n\nHe turned to the door, and the benevolent expression once more\nwandered athwart his face.\n\n\"Extremely kind of Mr. Peters!\" he said. \"Really, there is\nsomething almost Oriental in the lavish generosity of our\nAmerican cousins.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIt had taken R. Jones just six hours to discover Joan Valentine's",
        "address. That it had not taken him longer is a proof of his\nenergy and of the excellence of his system of obtaining\ninformation; but R. Jones, when he considered it worth his while,\ncould be extremely energetic, and he was a past master at the art\nof finding out things.\n\nHe poured himself out of his cab and rang the bell of Number\nSeven. A disheveled maid answered the ring.\n\n\"Miss Valentine in?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nR. Jones produced his card.",
        "\"On important business, tell her. Half a minute--I'll write it.\"\n\nHe wrote the words on the card and devoted the brief period of\nwaiting to a careful scrutiny of his surroundings. He looked out\ninto the court and he looked as far as he could down the dingy\npassage; and the conclusions he drew from what he saw were\ncomplimentary to Miss Valentine.\n\n\"If this girl is the sort of girl who would hold up Freddie's\nletters,\" he mused, \"she wouldn't be living in a place like this.",
        "If she were on the make she would have more money than she\nevidently possesses. Therefore, she is not on the make; and I am\nprepared to bet that she destroyed the letters as fast as she got\nthem.\"\n\nThose were, roughly, the thoughts of R. Jones as he stood in the\ndoorway of Number Seven; and they were important thoughts\ninasmuch as they determined his attitude toward Joan in the\napproaching interview. He perceived that this matter must be",
        "handled delicately--that he must be very much the gentleman. It\nwould be a strain, but he must do it.\n\nThe maid returned and directed him to Joan's room with a brief\nword and a sweeping gesture.\n\n\"Eh?\" said R. Jones. \"First floor?\"\n\n\"Front,\" said the maid.\n\nR. Jones trudged laboriously up the short flight of stairs. It\nwas very dark on the stairs and he stumbled. Eventually, however,\nlight came to him through an open door. Looking in, he saw a girl",
        "standing at the table. She had an air of expectation; so he\ndeduced that he had reached his journey's end.\n\n\"Miss Valentine?\"\n\n\"Please come in.\"\n\nR. Jones waddled in.\n\n\"Not much light on your stairs.\"\n\n\"No. Will you take a seat?\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nOne glance at the girl convinced R. Jones that he had been right.\nCircumstances had made him a rapid judge of character, for in the\nprofession of living by one's wits in a large city the first\nprinciple of offense and defense is to sum people up at first",
        "sight. This girl was not on the make.\n\nJoan Valentine was a tall girl with wheat-gold hair and eyes as\nbrightly blue as a November sky when the sun is shining on a\nfrosty world. There was in them a little of November's cold\nglitter, too, for Joan had been through much in the last few\nyears; and experience, even though it does not harden, erects a\ndefensive barrier between its children and the world.\n\nHer eyes were eyes that looked straight and challenged. They",
        "could thaw to the satin blue of the Mediterranean Sea, where it\npurrs about the little villages of Southern France; but they did\nnot thaw for everybody. She looked what she was--a girl of\naction; a girl whom life had made both reckless and wary--wary of\nfriendly advances, reckless when there was a venture afoot.\n\nHer eyes, as they met R. Jones' now, were cold and challenging.\nShe, too, had learned the trick of swift diagnosis of character,",
        "and what she saw of R. Jones in that first glance did not impress\nher favorably.\n\n\"You wished to see me on business?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said R. Jones. \"Yes. . . . Miss Valentine, may I begin by\nbegging you to realize that I have no intention of insulting\nyou?\"\n\nJoan's eyebrows rose. For an instant she did her visitor the\ninjustice of suspecting that he had been dining too well.\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Let me explain: I have come here,\" R. Jones went on, getting",
        "more gentlemanly every moment, \"on a very distasteful errand, to\noblige a friend. Will you bear in mind that whatever I say is\nsaid entirely on his behalf?\"\n\nBy this time Joan had abandoned the idea that this stout person\nwas a life-insurance tout, and was inclining to the view that he\nwas collecting funds for a charity.\n\n\"I came here at the request of the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"You never met him, Miss Valentine; but when you were in the",
        "chorus at the Piccadilly Theatre, I believe, he wrote you some\nvery foolish letters. Possibly you have forgotten them?\"\n\n\"I certainly have.\"\n\n\"You have probably destroyed them---eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly! I never keep letters. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well, you see, Miss Valentine, the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood is about to be married; and he thought that possibly,\non the whole, it would be better that the letters--and\npoetry--which he wrote you were nonexistent.\"",
        "Not all R. Jones' gentlemanliness--and during this speech he\ndiffused it like a powerful scent in waves about him--could hide\nthe unpleasant meaning of the words.\n\n\"He was afraid I might try to blackmail him?\" said Joan, with\nformidable calm.\n\nR. Jones raised and waved a fat hand deprecatingly.\n\n\"My dear Miss Valentine!\"\n\nJoan rose and R. Jones followed her example. The interview was\nplainly at an end.\n\n\"Please tell Mr. Threepwood to make his mind quite easy. He is in\nno danger.\"",
        "\"Exactly--exactly; precisely! I assured Threepwood that my visit\nhere would be a mere formality. I was quite sure you had no\nintention whatever of worrying him. I may tell him definitely,\nthen, that you have destroyed the letters?\"\n\n\"Yes. Good-evening.\"\n\n\"Good-evening, Miss Valentine.\"\n\nThe closing of the door behind him left him in total darkness,\nbut he hardly liked to return and ask Joan to reopen it in order\nto light him on his way. He was glad to be out of her presence.",
        "He was used to being looked at in an unfriendly way by his\nfellows, but there had been something in Joan's eyes that had\ncuriously discomfited him.\n\nR. Jones groped his way down, relieved that all was over and had\nended well. He believed what she had told him, and he could\nconscientiously assure Freddie that the prospect of his sharing\nthe fate of poor old Percy was nonexistent. It is true that he\nproposed to add in his report that the destruction of the letters",
        "had been purchased with difficulty, at a cost of just five\nhundred pounds; but that was a mere business formality.\n\nHe had almost reached the last step when there was a ring at the\nfront door. With what he was afterward wont to call an\ninspiration, he retreated with unusual nimbleness until he had\nalmost reached Joan's door again. Then he leaned over the\nbanister and listened.\n\nThe disheveled maid opened the door. A girl's voice spoke:\n\n\"Is Miss Valentine in?\"\n\n\"She's in; but she's engaged.\"",
        "\"I wish you would go up and tell her that I want to see her. Say\nit's Miss Peters--Miss Aline Peters.\"\n\nThe banister shook beneath R. Jones' sudden clutch. For a moment\nhe felt almost faint. Then he began to think swiftly. A great\nlight had dawned on him, and the thought outstanding in his mind\nwas that never again would he trust a man or woman on the\nevidence of his senses. He could have sworn that this Valentine\ngirl was on the level. He had been perfectly satisfied with her",
        "statement that she had destroyed the letters. And all the while\nshe had been playing as deep a game as he had come across in the\nwhole course of his professional career! He almost admired her.\nHow she had taken him in!\n\nIt was obvious now what her game was. Previous to his visit she\nhad arranged a meeting with Freddie's fiancee, with the view of\nopening negotiations for the sale of the letters. She had held\nhim, Jones, at arm's length because she was going to sell the",
        "letters to whoever would pay the best price. But for the accident\nof his happening to be here when Miss Peters arrived, Freddie and\nhis fiancee would have been bidding against each other and\nraising each other's price. He had worked the same game himself a\ndozen times, and he resented the entry of female competition into\nwhat he regarded as essentially a male field of enterprise.\n\nAs the maid stumped up the stairs he continued his retreat. He",
        "heard Joan's door open, and the stream of light showed him the\ndisheveled maid standing in the doorway.\n\n\"Ow, I thought there was a gentleman with you, miss.\"\n\n\"He left a moment ago. Why?\"\n\n\"There's a lady wants to see you. Miss Peters, her name is.\"\n\n\"Will you ask her to come up?\"\n\nThe disheveled maid was no polished mistress of ceremonies. She\nleaned down into the void and hailed Aline.\n\n\"She says will you come up?\"\n\nAline's feet became audible on the staircase. There were\ngreetings.",
        "\"Whatever brings you here, Aline?\"\n\n\"Am I interrupting you, Joan, dear?\"\n\n\"No. Do come in! I was only surprised to see you so late. I\ndidn't know you paid calls at this hour. Is anything wrong? Come\nin.\"\n\nThe door closed, the maid retired to the depths, and R. Jones\nstole cautiously down again. He was feeling absolutely\nbewildered. Apparently his deductions, his second thoughts, had\nbeen all wrong, and Joan was, after all, the honest person he had",
        "imagined at first sight. Those two girls had talked to each other\nas though they were old friends; as though they had known each\nother all their lives. That was the thing which perplexed R.\nJones.\n\nWith the tread of a red Indian, he approached the door and put\nhis ear to it. He found he could hear quite comfortably.\n\nAline, meantime, inside the room, had begun to draw comfort from\nJoan's very appearance, she looked so capable.\n\nJoan's eyes had changed the expression they had contained during",
        "the recent interview. They were soft now, with a softness that\nwas half compassionate, half contemptuous. It is the compensation\nwhich life gives to those whom it has handled roughly in order\nthat they shall be able to regard with a certain contempt the\nsmall troubles of the sheltered. Joan remembered Aline of old,\nand knew her for a perennial victim of small troubles. Even in\ntheir schooldays she had always needed to be looked after and",
        "comforted. Her sweet temper had seemed to invite the minor slings\nand arrows of fortune. Aline was a girl who inspired\nprotectiveness in a certain type of her fellow human beings. It\nwas this quality in her that kept George Emerson awake at nights;\nand it appealed to Joan now.\n\nJoan, for whom life was a constant struggle to keep the wolf\nwithin a reasonable distance from the door, and who counted that\nday happy on which she saw her way clear to paying her weekly",
        "rent and possibly having a trifle over for some coveted hat or\npair of shoes, could not help feeling, as she looked at Aline,\nthat her own troubles were as nothing, and that the immediate\nneed of the moment was to pet and comfort her friend. Her\nknowledge of Aline told her the probable tragedy was that she had\nlost a brooch or had been spoken to crossly by somebody; but it\nalso told her that such tragedies bulked very large on Aline's\nhorizon.",
        "Trouble, after all, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder;\nand Aline was far less able to endure with fortitude the loss of\na brooch than she herself to bear the loss of a position the\nemoluments of which meant the difference between having just\nenough to eat and starving.\n\n\"You're worried about something,\" she said. \"Sit down and tell me\nall about it.\"\n\nAline sat down and looked about her at the shabby room. By that\ncurious process of the human mind which makes the spectacle of",
        "another's misfortune a palliative for one's own, she was feeling\noddly comforted already. Her thoughts were not definite and she\ncould not analyze them; but what they amounted to was that,\nthough it was an unpleasant thing to be bullied by a dyspeptic\nfather, the world manifestly held worse tribulations, which her\nfather's other outstanding quality, besides dyspepsia--wealth, to\nwit--enabled her to avoid.\n\nIt was at this point that the dim beginnings of philosophy began",
        "to invade her mind. The thing resolved itself almost into an\nequation. If father had not had indigestion he would not have\nbullied her. But, if father had not made a fortune he would not\nhave had indigestion. Therefore, if father had not made a fortune\nhe would not have bullied her. Practically, in fact, if father\ndid not bully her he would not be rich. And if he were not rich--\n\nShe took in the faded carpet, the stained wall paper and the",
        "soiled curtains with a comprehensive glance. It certainly cut\nboth ways. She began to be a little ashamed of her misery.\n\n\"It's nothing at all; really,\" she said. \"I think I've been\nmaking rather a fuss about very little.\"\n\nJoan was relieved. The struggling life breeds moods of\ndepression, and such a mood had come to her just before Aline's\narrival. Life, at that moment, had seemed to stretch before her\nlike a dusty, weary road, without hope. She was sick of fighting.",
        "She wanted money and ease, and a surcease from this perpetual\nrace with the weekly bills. The mood had been the outcome partly\nof R. Jones' gentlemanly-veiled insinuations, but still more,\nthough she did not realize it, of her yesterday's meeting with\nAline.\n\nMr. Peters might be unguarded in his speech when conversing with\nhis daughter--he might play the tyrant toward her in many ways;\nbut he did not stint her in the matter of dress allowance, and,",
        "on the occasion when she met Joan, Aline had been wearing so\nParisian a hat and a tailor-made suit of such obviously expensive\nsimplicity that green-eyed envy had almost spoiled Joan's\npleasure at meeting this friend of her opulent days.\n\nShe had suppressed the envy, and it had revenged itself by\nassaulting her afresh in the form of the worst fit of the blues\nshe had had in two years.\n\nShe had been loyally ready to sink her depression in order to",
        "alleviate Aline's, but it was a distinct relief to find that the\nfeat would not be necessary.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said. \"Tell me what the very little thing was.\"\n\n\"It was only father,\" said Aline simply.\n\nJoan cast her mind back to the days of school and placed father\nas a rather irritable person, vaguely reputed to be something of\nan ogre in his home circle.\n\n\"Was he angry with you about something?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not exactly angry with me; but--well, I was there.\"",
        "Joan's depression lifted slightly. She had forgotten, in the\nstunning anguish of the sudden spectacle of that hat and that\ntailor-made suit, that Paris hats and hundred-and-twenty-dollar\nsuits not infrequently had what the vulgar term a string attached\nto them. After all, she was independent. She might have to murder\nher beauty with hats and frocks that had never been nearer Paris\nthan the Tottenham Court Road; but at least no one bullied her",
        "because she happened to be at hand when tempers were short.\n\n\"What a shame!\" she said. \"Tell me all about it.\"\n\nWith a prefatory remark that it was all so ridiculous, really,\nAline embarked on the narrative of the afternoon's events.\n\nJoan heard her out, checking a strong disposition to giggle. Her\nviewpoint was that of the average person, and the average person\ncannot see the importance of the scarab in the scheme of things.\nThe opinion she formed of Mr. Peters was of his being an",
        "eccentric old gentleman, making a great to-do about nothing at\nall. Losses had to have a concrete value before they could\nimpress Joan. It was beyond her to grasp that Mr. Peters would\nsooner have lost a diamond necklace, if he had happened to\npossess one, than his Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty.\n\nIt was not until Aline, having concluded her tale, added one more\nstrand to it that she found herself treating the matter\nseriously.\n\n\"Father says he would give five thousand dollars to anyone who",
        "would get it back for him.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\nThe whole story took on a different complexion for Joan. Money\ntalks. Mr. Peters' words might have been merely the rhetorical\noutburst of a heated moment; but, even discounting them, there\nseemed to remain a certain exciting substratum. A man who shouts\nthat he will give five thousand dollars for a thing may very well\nmean he will give five hundred, and Joan's finances were\nperpetually in a condition which makes five hundred dollars a sum\nto be gasped at.",
        "\"He wasn't serious, surely!\"\n\n\"I think he was,\" said Aline.\n\n\"But five thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"It isn't really very much to father, you know. He gave away a\nhundred thousand a year ago to a university.\"\n\n\"But for a grubby little scarab!\"\n\n\"You don't understand how father loves his scarabs. Since he\nretired from business, he has been simply wrapped up in them. You\nknow collectors are like that. You read in the papers about men\ngiving all sorts of money for funny things.\"",
        "Outside the door R. Jones, his ear close to the panel, drank in\nall these things greedily. He would have been willing to remain\nin that attitude indefinitely in return for this kind of special\ninformation; but just as Aline said these words a door opened on\nthe floor above, and somebody came out, whistling, and began to\ndescend the stairs.\n\nR. Jones stood not on the order of his going. He was down in the\nhall and fumbling with the handle of the front door with an",
        "agility of which few casual observers of his dimensions would\nhave deemed him capable. The next moment he was out in the\nstreet, walking calmly toward Leicester Square, pondering over\nwhat he had heard.\n\nMuch of R. Jones' substantial annual income was derived from\npondering over what he had heard.\n\nIn the room Joan was looking at Aline with the distended eyes of\none who sees visions or has inspirations. She got up. There are\noccasions when one must speak standing.",
        "\"Then you mean to say that your father would really give five\nthousand dollars to anyone who got this thing back for him?\"\n\n\"I am sure he would. But who could do it?\"\n\n\"I could,\" said Joan. \"And what is more, I'm going to!\"\n\nAline stared at her helplessly. In their schooldays, Joan had\nalways swept her off her feet. Then, she had always had the\nfeeling that with Joan nothing was impossible. Heroine worship,\nlike hero worship, dies hard. She looked at Joan now with the",
        "stricken sensation of one who has inadvertently set powerful\nmachinery in motion.\n\n\"But, Joan!\" It was all she could say.\n\n\"My dear child, it's perfectly simple. This earl of yours has\ntaken the thing off to his castle, like a brigand. You say you\nare going down there on Friday for a visit. All you have to do is\nto take me along with you, and sit back and watch me get busy.\"\n\n\"But, Joan!\"\n\n\"Where's the difficulty?\"\n\n\"I don't see how I could take you down very well.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"",
        "\"Oh, I don't know.\"\n\n\"But what is your objection?\"\n\n\"Well--don't you see?--if you went down there as a friend of mine\nand were caught stealing the scarab, there would be just the\ntrouble father wants to avoid--about my engagement, you see, and\nso on.\"\n\nIt was an aspect of the matter that had escaped Joan. She frowned\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"I see. Yes, there is that; but there must be a way.\"\n\n\"You mustn't, Joan--really! don't think any more about it.\"",
        "\"Not think any more about it! My child, do you even faintly\nrealize what five thousand dollars--or a quarter of five thousand\ndollars--means to me? I would do anything for it--anything! And\nthere's the fun of it. I don't suppose you can realize that,\neither. I want a change. I've been grubbing away here on nothing\na week for years, and it's time I had a vacation. There must be a\nway by which you could get me down--Why, of course! Why didn't I",
        "think of it before! You shall take me on Friday as your lady's\nmaid!\"\n\n\"But, Joan, I couldn't!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I--I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh, well!\"\n\nJoan advanced on her where she sat and grasped her firmly by the\nshoulders. Her face was inflexible.\n\n\"Aline, my pet, it's no good arguing. You might just as well\nargue with a wolf on the trail of a fat Russian peasant. I need\nthat money. I need it in my business. I need it worse than",
        "anybody has ever needed anything. And I'm going to have it! From\nnow on, until further notice, I am your lady's maid. You can give\nyour present one a holiday.\"\n\nAline met her eyes waveringly. The spirit of the old schooldays,\nwhen nothing was impossible where Joan was concerned, had her in\nits grip. Moreover, the excitement of the scheme began to attract\nher.\n\n\"But, Joan,\" she said, \"you know it's simply ridiculous. You\ncould never pass as a lady's maid. The other servants would find",
        "you out. I expect there are all sorts of things a lady's maid has\ngot to do and not do.\"\n\n\"My dear Aline, I know them all. You can't stump me on\nbelow-stairs etiquette. I've been a lady's maid!\"\n\n\"Joan!\"\n\n\"It's quite true--three years ago, when I was more than usually\nimpecunious. The wolf was glued to the door like a postage stamp;\nso I answered an advertisement and became a lady's maid.\"\n\n\"You seem to have done everything.\"\n\n\"I have--pretty nearly. It's all right for you idle rich,",
        "Aline--you can sit still and contemplate life; but we poor\nworking girls have got to hustle.\"\n\nAline laughed.\n\n\"You know, you always could make me do anything you wanted in the\nold days, Joan. I suppose I have got to look on this as quite\nsettled now?\"\n\n\"Absolutely settled! Oh, Aline, there's one thing you must\nremember: Don't call me Joan when I'm down at the castle. You\nmust call me Valentine.\"\n\nShe paused. The recollection of the Honorable Freddie had come to\nher. No; Valentine would not do!",
        "\"No; not Valentine,\" she went on--\"it's too jaunty. I used it\nonce years ago, but it never sounded just right. I want something\nmore respectable, more suited to my position. Can't you suggest\nsomething?\"\n\nAline pondered.\n\n\"Simpson?\"\n\n\"Simpson! It's exactly right. You must practice it. Simpson! Say\nit kindly and yet distantly, as though I were a worm, but a worm\nfor whom you felt a mild liking. Roll it round your tongue.\"\n\n\"Simpson.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Now once again--a little more haughtily.\"",
        "\"Simpson--Simpson--Simpson.\"\n\nJoan regarded her with affectionate approval.\n\n\"It's wonderful!\" she said. \"You might have been doing it all\nyour life.\"\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" asked Aline.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Joan. \"I was just thinking of something. There's\na young man who lives on the floor above this, and I was\nlecturing him yesterday on enterprise. I told him to go and find\nsomething exciting to do. I wonder what he would say if he knew\nhow thoroughly I am going to practice what I preach!\"",
        "CHAPTER IV\n\nIn the morning following Aline's visit to Joan Valentine, Ashe\nsat in his room, the Morning Post on the table before him. The\nheady influence of Joan had not yet ceased to work within him;\nand he proposed, in pursuance of his promise to her, to go\ncarefully through the columns of advertisements, however\npessimistic he might feel concerning the utility of that action.\n\nHis first glance assured him that the vast fortunes of the",
        "philanthropists, whose acquaintance he had already made in print,\nwere not yet exhausted. Brian MacNeill still dangled his gold\nbefore the public; so did Angus Bruce; so did Duncan Macfarlane\nand Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They still had the\nmoney and they still wanted to give it away.\n\nAshe was reading listlessly down the column when, from the mass\nof advertisements, one of an unusual sort detached itself.\n\n   WANTED: Young Man of good appearance, who is poor and",
        "reckless, to undertake a delicate and dangerous enterprise.\n   Good pay for the right man. Apply between the hours of ten\n   and twelve at offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole,\n   3, Denvers Street, Strand.\n\nAnd as he read it, half past ten struck on the little clock on\nhis mantelpiece. It was probably this fact that decided Ashe. If\nhe had been compelled to postpone his visit to the offices of\nMessrs. Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole until the afternoon, it is",
        "possible that barriers of laziness might have reared themselves\nin the path of adventure; for Ashe, an adventurer at heart, was\nalso uncommonly lazy. As it was, however, he could make an\nimmediate start.\n\nPausing but to put on his shoes, and having satisfied himself by\na glance in the mirror that his appearance was reasonably good,\nhe seized his hat, shot out of the narrow mouth of Arundell Street\nlike a shell, and scrambled into a taxicab, with the feeling",
        "that--short of murder--they could not make it too delicate and\ndangerous for him.\n\nHe was conscious of strange thrills. This, he told himself, was\nthe only possible mode of life with spring in the air. He had\nalways been partial to those historical novels in which the\ncharacters are perpetually vaulting on chargers and riding across\ncountry on perilous errands. This leaping into taxicabs to answer\nstimulating advertisements in the Morning Post was very much the",
        "same sort of thing. It was with fine fervor animating him that he\nentered the gloomy offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole. His\nbrain was afire and he felt ready for anything.\n\n\"I have come in ans--\" he began, to the diminutive office boy,\nwho seemed to be the nearest thing visible to a Mainprice or a\nBoole.\n\n\"Siddown. Gottatakeyerturn,\" said the office boy; and for the\nfirst time Ashe perceived that the ante-room in which he stood\nwas crowded to overflowing.",
        "This, in the circumstances, was something of a damper. He had\npictured himself, during his ride in the cab, striding into the\noffice and saying. \"The delicate and dangerous enterprise. Lead\nme to it!\" He had not realized until now that he was not the only\nman in London who read the advertisement columns of the Morning\nPost, and for an instant his heart sank at the sight of all this\ncompetition. A second and more comprehensive glance at his rivals\ngave him confidence.",
        "The Wanted column of the morning paper is a sort of dredger,\nwhich churns up strange creatures from the mud of London's\nunderworld. Only in response to the dredger's operations do they\ncome to the surface in such numbers as to be noticeable, for as a\nrule they are of a solitary habit and shun company; but when they\ndo come they bring with them something of the horror of the\ndepths.\n\nIt is the saddest spectacle in the world--that of the crowd",
        "collected by a Wanted advertisement. They are so palpably not\nwanted by anyone for any purpose whatsoever; yet every time they\ngather together with a sort of hopeful hopelessness. What they\nwere originally--the units of these collections--Heaven knows.\nFate has battered out of them every trace of individuality. Each\nnow is exactly like his neighbor--no worse; no better.\n\nAshe, as he sat and watched them, was filled with conflicting\nemotions. One-half of him, thrilled with the glamour of",
        "adventure, was chafing at the delay, and resentful of these poor\ncreatures as of so many obstacles to the beginning of all the\nbrisk and exciting things that lay behind the mysterious brevity\nof the advertisement; the other, pitifully alive to the tragedy\nof the occasion, was grateful for the delay.\n\nOn the whole, he was glad to feel that if one of these derelicts\ndid not secure the \"good pay for the right man,\" it would not be\nhis fault. He had been the last to arrive, and he would be the",
        "last to pass through that door, which was the gateway of\nadventure--the door with Mr. Boole inscribed on its ground glass,\nbehind which sat the author of the mysterious request for\nassistance, interviewing applicants. It would be through their\nown shortcomings--not because of his superior attractions--if\nthey failed to please that unseen arbiter.\n\nThat they were so failing was plain. Scarcely had one scarred\nvictim of London's unkindness passed through before the bell",
        "would ring; the office boy, who, in the intervals of frowning\nsternly on the throng, as much as to say that he would stand no\nnonsense, would cry, \"Next!\" and another dull-eyed wreck would\ndrift through, to be followed a moment later by yet another. The\none fact at present ascertainable concerning the unknown searcher\nfor reckless young men of good appearance was that he appeared to\nbe possessed of considerable decision of character, a man who did",
        "not take long to make up his mind. He was rejecting applicants\nnow at the rate of two a minute.\n\nExpeditious though he was, he kept Ashe waiting for a\nconsiderable time. It was not until the hands of the fat clock\nover the door pointed to twenty minutes past eleven that the\noffice boy's \"Next!\" found him the only survivor. He gave his\nclothes a hasty smack with the palm of his hand and his hair a\nfleeting dab to accentuate his good appearance, and turned the\nhandle of the door of fate.",
        "The room assigned by the firm to their Mr. Boole for his personal\nuse was a small and dingy compartment, redolent of that\natmosphere of desolation which lawyers alone know how to achieve.\nIt gave the impression of not having been swept since the\nfoundation of the firm, in the year 1786. There was one small\nwindow, covered with grime. It was one of those windows you see\nonly in lawyers' offices. Possibly some reckless Mainprice or\nharebrained Boole had opened it in a fit of mad excitement",
        "induced by the news of the Battle of Waterloo, in 1815, and had\nbeen instantly expelled from the firm. Since then, no one had\ndared to tamper with it.\n\nGazing through this window--or, rather, gazing at it, for X-rays\ncould hardly have succeeded in actually penetrating the alluvial\ndeposits on the glass--was a little man. As Ashe entered, he\nturned and looked at him as though he hurt him rather badly in\nsome tender spot.\n\nAshe was obliged to own to himself that he felt a little nervous.",
        "It is not every day that a young man of good appearance, who has\nled a quiet life, meets face to face one who is prepared to pay\nhim well for doing something delicate and dangerous. To Ashe the\nsensation was entirely novel. The most delicate and dangerous act\nhe had performed to date had been the daily mastication of Mrs.\nBell's breakfast--included in the rent. Yes, he had to admit\nit--he was nervous: and the fact that he was nervous made him hot\nand uncomfortable.",
        "To judge him by his appearance, the man at the window was also\nhot and uncomfortable. He was a little, truculent-looking man,\nand his face at present was red with a flush that sat unnaturally\non a normally lead-colored face. His eyes looked out from under\nthick gray eyebrows with an almost tortured expression. This was\npartly owing to the strain of interviewing Ashe's preposterous\npredecessors, but principally to the fact that the little man had",
        "suddenly been seized with acute indigestion, a malady to which he\nwas peculiarly subject.\n\nHe removed from his mouth the black cigar he was smoking,\ninserted a digestive tabloid, and replaced the cigar. Then he\nconcentrated his attention on Ashe. As he did so the hostile\nexpression of his face became modified. He looked surprised\nand--grudgingly--pleased.\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\" he said.\n\n\"I came in answer to--\"\n\n\"In answer to my advertisement? I had given up hope of seeing",
        "anything part human. I thought you must be one of the clerks.\nYou're certainly more like what I advertised for. Of all the\nseedy bunches of dead beats I ever struck, the aggregation I've\njust been interviewing was the seediest! When I spend good money\nin advertising for a young man of good appearance, I want a young\nman of good appearance--not a tramp of fifty-five.\"\n\nAshe was sorry for his predecessors, but he was bound to admit\nthat they certainly had corresponded somewhat faithfully to the",
        "description just given. The comparative cordiality of his own\nreception removed the slight nervousness that had been troubling\nhim. He began to feel confident--almost jaunty.\n\n\"I'm through,\" said the little man wearily. \"I've had enough of\ninterviewing applicants. You're the last one I'll see. Are there\nany more hobos outside?\"\n\n\"Not when I came in.\"\n\n\"Then we'll get down to business. I'll tell you what I want done,\nand if you are willing you can do it; if you are not willing you",
        "can leave it--and go to the devil! Sit down.\"\n\nAshe sat down. He resented the little man's tone, but this was\nnot the moment for saying so. His companion scrutinized him\nnarrowly.\n\n\"So far as appearance goes,\" he said, \"you are what I want.\" Ashe\nfelt inclined to bow. \"Whoever takes on this job has got to act\nas my valet, and you look like a valet.\" Ashe felt less inclined\nto bow.\n\n\"You're tall and thin and ordinary-looking. Yes; so far as\nappearance goes, you fill the bill.\"",
        "It seemed to Ashe that it was time to correct an impression the\nlittle man appeared to have formed.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"if all you want is a valet, you will\nhave to look elsewhere. I got the idea from your advertisement\nthat something rather more exciting was in the air. I can\nrecommend you to several good employment agencies if you wish.\"\nHe rose. \"Good-morning!\" he said.\n\nHe would have liked to fling the massive pewter inkwell at this\nlittle creature who had so keenly disappointed him.",
        "\"Sit down!\" snapped the other.\n\nAshe resumed his seat. The hope of adventure dies hard on a\nSpring morning when one is twenty-six, and he had the feeling\nthat there was more to come.\n\n\"Don't be a damned fool!\" said the little man. \"Of course I'm not\nasking you to be a valet and nothing else.\"\n\n\"You would want me to do some cooking and plain sewing on the\nside, perhaps?\"\n\nTheir eyes met in a hostile glare. The flush on the little man's\nface deepened.",
        "\"Are you trying to get fresh with me?\" he demanded dangerously.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ashe.\n\nThe answer seemed to disconcert his adversary. He was silent for\na moment.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"maybe it's all for the best. If you\nweren't full of gall probably you wouldn't have come here at all;\nand whoever takes on this job of mine has got to have gall if he\nhas nothing else. I think we shall suit each other.\"\n\n\"What is the job?\"\n\nThe little man's face showed doubt and perplexity.",
        "\"It's awkward. If I'm to make the thing clear to you I've got to\ntrust you. And I don't know a thing about you. I wish I had\nthought of that before I inserted the advertisement.\"\n\nAshe appreciated the difficulty.\n\n\"Couldn't you make an A--B case out of it?\"\n\n\"Maybe I could if I knew what an A--B case was.\"\n\n\"Call the people mixed up in it A and B.\"\n\n\"And forget, halfway through, who was which! No; I guess I'll\nhave to trust you.\"\n\n\"I'll play square.\"",
        "The little man fastened his eyes on Ashe's in a piercing stare.\nAshe met them smilingly. His spirits, always fairly cheerful, had\nrisen high by now. There was something about the little man, in\nspite of his brusqueness and ill temper, which made him feel\nflippant.\n\n\"Pure white!\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"My soul! And this\"--he thumped the left section of his\nwaistcoat--\"solid gold. You may fire when ready, Gridley.\nProceed, professor.\"\n\n\"I don't know where to begin.\"",
        "\"Without presuming to dictate, why not at the beginning?\"\n\n\"It's all so darned complicated that I don't rightly know which\nis the beginning. Well, see here . . . I collect scarabs. I'm\ncrazy about scarabs. Ever since I quit business, you might say\nthat I have practically lived for scarabs.\"\n\n\"Though it sounds like an unkind thing to say of anyone,\" said\nAshe. \"Incidentally, what are scarabs?\" He held up his hand.\n\"Wait! It all comes back to me. Expensive classical education,",
        "now bearing belated fruit. Scarabaeus--Latin; noun, nominative--a\nbeetle. Scarabaee--vocative--O you beetle! Scarabaeum--\naccusative--the beetle. Scarabaei--of the beetle. Scarabaeo--to\nor for the beetle. I remember now. Egypt--Rameses--pyramids--\nsacred scarabs! Right!\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I've gotten together the best collection of\nscarabs outside the British Museum, and some of them are worth\nwhat you like to me. I don't reckon money when it comes to a\nquestion of my scarabs. Do you understand?\"",
        "\"Sure, Mike!\"\n\nDispleasure clouded the little man's face.\n\n\"My name is not Mike.\"\n\n\"I used the word figuratively, as it were.\"\n\n\"Well, don't do it again. My name is J. Preston Peters, and Mr.\nPeters will do as well as anything else when you want to attract\nmy attention.\"\n\n\"Mine is Marson. You were saying, Mr. Peters--?\"\n\n\"Well, it's this way,\" said the little man.\n\nShakespeare and Pope have both emphasized the tediousness of a\ntwice-told tale; the Episode Of the Stolen Scarab need not be",
        "repeated at this point, though it must be admitted that Mr.\nPeters' version of it differed considerably from the calm,\ndispassionate description the author, in his capacity of official\nhistorian, has given earlier in the story.\n\nIn Mr. Peters' version the Earl of Emsworth appeared as a smooth\nand purposeful robber, a sort of elderly Raffles, worming his way\ninto the homes of the innocent, and only sparing that portion of\ntheir property which was too heavy for him to carry away. Mr.",
        "Peters, indeed, specifically described the Earl of Emsworth as an\noily old second-story man.\n\nIt took Ashe some little time to get a thorough grasp of the\ntangled situation; but he did it at last.\n\nOnly one point perplexed him.\n\n\"You want to hire somebody to go to this castle and get this\nscarab back for you. I follow that. But why must he go as your\nvalet?\"\n\n\"That's simple enough. You don't think I'm asking him to buy a\nblack mask and break in, do you? I'm making it as easy for him as",
        "possible. I can't take a secretary down to the castle, for\neverybody knows that, now I've retired, I haven't got a\nsecretary; and if I engaged a new one and he was caught trying to\nsteal my scarab from the earl's collection, it would look\nsuspicious. But a valet is different. Anyone can get fooled by a\ncrook valet with bogus references.\"\n\n\"I see. There's just one other point: Suppose your accomplice\ndoes get caught--what then?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Peters, \"is the catch; and it's just because of",
        "that I am offering good pay to my man. We'll suppose, for the\nsake of argument, that you accept the contract and get caught.\nWell, if that happens you've got to look after yourself. I\ncouldn't say a word. If I did it would all come out, and so far\nas the breaking off of my daughter's engagement to young\nThreepwood is concerned, it would be just as bad as though I had\ntried to get the thing back myself.\n\n\"You've got to bear that in mind. You've got to remember it if",
        "you forget everything else. I don't appear in this business in\nany way whatsoever. If you get caught you take what's coming to\nyou without a word. You can't turn round and say: 'I am innocent.\nMr. Peters will explain all'--because Mr. Peters certainly won't.\nMr. Peters won't utter a syllable of protest if they want to hang\nyou.\n\n\"No; if you go into this, young man, you go into it with your\neyes open. You go into it with a full understanding of the",
        "risks--because you think the reward, if you are successful, makes\nthe taking of those risks worth while. You and I know that what\nyou are doing isn't really stealing; it's simply a tactful way of\ngetting back my own property. But the judge and jury will have\ndifferent views.\"\n\n\"I am beginning to understand,\" said Ashe thoughtfully, \"why you\ncalled the job delicate and dangerous.\"\n\nCertainly it had been no overstatement. As a writer of detective",
        "stories for the British office boy, he had imagined in his time\nmany undertakings that might be so described, but few to which\nthe description was more admirably suited.\n\n\"It is,\" said Mr. Peters; \"and that is why I'm offering good pay.\nWhoever carries this job through gets one thousand pounds.\"\n\nAshe started.\n\n\"One thousand pounds--five thousand dollars!\"\n\n\"Five thousand.\"\n\n\"When do I begin?\"\n\n\"You'll do it?\"\n\n\"For five thousand dollars I certainly will.\"\n\n\"With your eyes open?\"\n\n\"Wide open!\"",
        "A look of positive geniality illuminated Mr. Peters' pinched\nfeatures. He even went so far as to pat Ashe on the shoulder.\n\n\"Good boy!\" he said. \"Meet me at Paddington Station at four\no'clock on Friday. And if there's anything more you want to know\ncome round to this address.\"\n\nThere remained the telling of Joan Valentine; for it was\nobviously impossible not to tell her. When you have\nrevolutionized your life at the bidding of another you cannot",
        "well conceal the fact, as though nothing had happened. Ashe had\nnot the slightest desire to conceal the fact. On the contrary, he\nwas glad to have such a capital excuse for renewing the\nacquaintance.\n\nHe could not tell her, of course, the secret details of the\nthing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go\nairily in and say:\n\n\"You know what you told me about doing something new? Well, I've\njust got a job as a valet.\"\n\nSo he went airily in and said it.\n\n\"To whom?\" said Joan.",
        "\"To a man named Peters--an American.\"\n\nWomen are trained from infancy up to conceal their feelings. Joan\ndid not start or otherwise express emotion.\n\n\"Not Mr. J. Preston Peters?\"\n\n\"Yes. Do you know him? What a remarkable thing.\"\n\n\"His daughter,\" said Joan, \"has just engaged me as a lady's\nmaid.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"It will not be quite the same thing as three years ago,\" Joan\nexplained. \"It is just a cheap way of getting a holiday. I used\nto know Miss Peters very well, you see. It will be more like",
        "traveling as her guest.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" Ashe had not yet overcome his amazement.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"But what an extraordinary coincidence!\"\n\n\"Yes. By the way, how did you get the situation? And what put it\ninto your head to be a valet at all? It seems such a curious\nthing for you to think of doing.\"\n\nAshe was embarrassed.\n\n\"I--I--well, you see, the experience will be useful to me, of\ncourse, in my writing.\"\n\n\"Oh! Are you thinking of taking up my line of work? Dukes?\"\n\n\"No, no--not exactly that.\"",
        "\"It seems so odd. How did you happen to get in touch with Mr.\nPeters?\"\n\n\"Oh, I answered an advertisement.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nAshe was becoming conscious of an undercurrent of something not\naltogether agreeable in the conversation. It lacked the gay ease\nof their first interview. He was not apprehensive lest she might\nhave guessed his secret. There was, he felt, no possible means by\nwhich she could have done that. Yet the fact remained that those",
        "keen blue eyes of hers were looking at him in a peculiar and\npenetrating manner. He felt damped.\n\n\"It will be nice, being together,\" he said feebly.\n\n\"Very!\" said Joan.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I thought I would come and tell you.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n\"It seems so funny that you should be going out as a lady's\nmaid.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"But, of course, you have done it before.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The really extraordinary thing is that we should be going to the\nsame people.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"",
        "\"It--it's remarkable, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAshe reflected. No; he did not appear to have any further remarks\nto make.\n\n\"Good-by for the present,\" he said.\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\nAshe drifted out. He was conscious of a wish that he understood\ngirls. Girls, in his opinion, were odd.\n\nWhen he had gone Joan Valentine hurried to the door and, having\nopened it an inch, stood listening. When the sound of his door\nclosing came to her she ran down the stairs and out into Arundell",
        "Street. She went to the Hotel Mathis.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said to the sad-eyed waiter, \"if you have a copy\nof the Morning Post?\"\n\nThe waiter, a child of romantic Italy, was only too anxious to\noblige youth and beauty. He disappeared and presently returned\nwith a crumpled copy. Joan thanked him with a bright smile.\n\nBack in her room, she turned to the advertisement pages. She knew\nthat life was full of what the unthinking call coincidences; but",
        "the miracle of Ashe having selected by chance the father of Aline\nPeters as an employer was too much of a coincidence for her.\nSuspicion furrowed her brow.\n\nIt did not take her long to discover the advertisement that had\nsent Ashe hurrying in a taxicab to the offices of Messrs.\nMainprice, Mainprice & Boole. She had been looking for something\nof the kind.\n\nShe read it through twice and smiled. Everything was very clear\nto her. She looked at the ceiling above her and shook her head.",
        "\"You are quite a nice young man, Mr. Marson,\" she said softly;\n\"but you mustn't try to jump my claim. I dare say you need that\nmoney too; but I'm afraid you must go without. I am going to have\nit--and nobody else!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe four-fifteen express slid softly out of Paddington Station\nand Ashe Marson settled himself in the corner seat of his\nsecond-class compartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had begun\nto read a magazine. Along the corridor, in a first-class smoking",
        "compartment, Mr. Peters was lighting a big black cigar. Still\nfarther along the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking\ncompartment, Aline Peters looked through the window and thought\nof many things.\n\nIn English trains the tipping classes travel first; valets,\nlady's maids, footmen, nurses, and head stillroom maids, second;\nand housemaids, grooms, and minor and inferior stillroom maids,\nthird. But for these social distinctions, the whole fabric of",
        "society would collapse and anarchy stalk naked through the\nland--as in the United States.\n\nAshe was feeling remarkably light-hearted. He wished he had not\nbought Joan that magazine and thus deprived himself temporarily\nof the pleasure of her conversation; but that was the only flaw\nin his happiness. With the starting of the train, which might be\nconsidered the formal and official beginning of the delicate and\ndangerous enterprise on which he had embarked, he had definitely",
        "come to the conclusion that the life adventurous was the life for\nhim. He had frequently suspected this to be the case, but it had\nrequired the actual experiment to bring certainty.\n\nAlmost more than physical courage, the ideal adventurer needs a\ncertain lively inquisitiveness, the quality of not being content\nto mind his own affairs; and in Ashe this quality was highly\ndeveloped. From boyhood up he had always been interested in\nthings that were none of his business. And it is just that",
        "attribute which the modern young man, as a rule, so sadly lacks.\n\nThe modern young man may do adventurous things if they are thrust\non him; but left to himself he will edge away uncomfortably and\nlook in the other direction when the goddess of adventure smiles\nat him. Training and tradition alike pluck at his sleeve and urge\nhim not to risk making himself ridiculous. And from sheer horror\nof laying himself open to the charge of not minding his own",
        "business he falls into a stolid disregard of all that is out of\nthe ordinary and exciting. He tells himself that the shriek from\nthe lonely house he passed just now was only the high note of\nsome amateur songstress, and that the maiden in distress whom he\nsaw pursued by the ruffian with a knife was merely earning the\nsalary paid her by some motion-picture firm. And he proceeds on\nhis way, looking neither to left nor right.\n\nAshe had none of this degenerate coyness toward adventure. Though",
        "born within easy distance of Boston and deposited by\ncircumstances in London, he possessed, nevertheless, to a\nremarkable degree, that quality so essentially the property of\nthe New Yorker--the quality known, for want of a more polished\nword, as rubber. It is true that it had needed the eloquence of\nJoan Valentine to stir him from his groove; but that was because\nhe was also lazy. He loved new sights and new experiences. Yes;\nhe was happy. The rattle of the train shaped itself into a lively",
        "march. He told himself that he had found the right occupation for\na young man in the Spring.\n\nJoan, meantime, intrenched behind her magazine, was also busy\nwith her thoughts. She was not reading the magazine; she held it\nbefore her as a protection, knowing that if she laid it down Ashe\nwould begin to talk. And just at present she had no desire for\nconversation. She, like Ashe, was contemplating the immediate\nfuture, but, unlike him, was not doing so with much pleasure. She",
        "was regretting heartily that she had not resisted the temptation\nto uplift this young man and wishing that she had left him to\nwallow in the slothful peace in which she had found him.\n\nIt is curious how frequently in this world our attempts to\nstimulate and uplift swoop back on us and smite us like\nboomerangs. Ashe's presence was the direct outcome of her lecture\non enterprise, and it added a complication to an already\ncomplicated venture.",
        "She did her best to be fair to Ashe. It was not his fault that he\nwas about to try to deprive her of five thousand dollars, which\nshe looked on as her personal property; but illogically she found\nherself feeling a little hostile.\n\nShe glanced furtively at him over the magazine, choosing by ill\nchance a moment when he had just directed his gaze at her. Their\neyes met and there was nothing for it but to talk; so she tucked\naway her hostility in a corner of her mind, where she could find",
        "it again when she wanted it, and prepared for the time being to\nbe friendly. After all, except for the fact that he was her\nrival, this was a pleasant and amusing young man, and one for\nwhom, until he made the announcement that had changed her whole\nattitude toward him, she had entertained a distinct feeling of\nfriendship--nothing warmer.\n\nThere was something about him that made her feel that she would\nhave liked to stroke his hair in a motherly way and straighten",
        "his tie, and have cozy chats with him in darkened rooms by the\nlight of open fires, and make him tell her his inmost thoughts,\nand stimulate him to do something really worth while with his\nlife; but this, she held, was merely the instinct of a generous\nnature to be kind and helpful even to a comparative stranger.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Marson,\" she said, \"Here we are!\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was thinking,\" said Ashe.\n\nHe was conscious of a marked increase in the exhilaration the",
        "starting of the expedition had brought to him. At the back of his\nmind he realized there had been all along a kind of wistful\nresentment at the change in this girl's manner toward him.\nDuring the brief conversation when he had told her of his having\nsecured his present situation, and later, only a few minutes\nback, on the platform of Paddington Station, he had sensed a\ncoldness, a certain hostility--so different from her pleasant\nfriendliness at their first meeting.",
        "She had returned now to her earlier manner and he was surprised\nat the difference it made. He felt somehow younger, more alive.\nThe lilt of the train's rattle changed to a gay ragtime. This was\ncurious, because Joan was nothing more than a friend. He was not\nin love with her. One does not fall in love with a girl whom one\nhas met only three times. One is attracted--yes; but one does not\nfall in love.\n\nA moment's reflection enabled him to diagnose his sensations",
        "correctly. This odd impulse to leap across the compartment and\nkiss Joan was not love. It was merely the natural desire of a\ngood-hearted young man to be decently chummy with his species.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of it all, Mr. Marson?\" said Joan. \"Are\nyou sorry or glad that you let me persuade you to do this\nperfectly mad thing? I feel responsible for you, you know. If it\nhad not been for me you would have been comfortably in Arundell\nStreet, writing your Wand of Death.\"\n\n\"I'm glad.\"",
        "\"You don't feel any misgivings now that you are actually\ncommitted to domestic service?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\nJoan, against her will, smiled approval on this uncompromising\nattitude. This young man might be her rival, but his demeanor on\nthe eve of perilous times appealed to her. That was the spirit\nshe liked and admired--that reckless acceptance of whatever might\ncome. It was the spirit in which she herself had gone into the\naffair and she was pleased to find that it animated Ashe",
        "also--though, to be sure, it had its drawbacks. It made his\nrivalry the more dangerous. This reflection injected a touch of\nthe old hostility into her manner.\n\n\"I wonder whether you will continue to feel so brave.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nJoan perceived that she was in danger of going too far. She had\nno wish to unmask Ashe at the expense of revealing her own\nsecret. She must resist the temptation to hint that she had\ndiscovered his.\n\n\"I meant,\" she said quickly, \"that from what I have seen of him",
        "Mr. Peters seems likely to be a rather trying man to work for.\"\n\nAshe's face cleared. For a moment he had almost suspected that\nshe had guessed his errand.\n\n\"Yes. I imagine he will be. He is what you might call\nquick-tempered. He has dyspepsia, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"What he wants is plenty of fresh air and no cigars, and a\nregular course of those Larsen Exercises that amused you so\nmuch.\"\n\nJoan laughed.\n\n\"Are you going to try and persuade Mr. Peters to twist himself",
        "about like that? Do let me see it if you do.\"\n\n\"I wish I could.\"\n\n\"Do suggest it to him.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he would resent it from a valet?\"\n\n\"I keep forgetting that you are a valet. You look so unlike one.\"\n\n\"Old Peters didn't think so. He rather complimented me on my\nappearance. He said I was ordinary-looking.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have called you that. You look so very strong and\nfit.\"\n\n\"Surely there are muscular valets?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I suppose there are.\"",
        "Ashe looked at her. He was thinking that never in his life had he\nseen a girl so amazingly pretty. What it was that she had done to\nherself was beyond him; but something, some trick of dress, had\ngiven her a touch of the demure that made her irresistible. She\nwas dressed in sober black, the ideal background for her\nfairness.\n\n\"While on the subject,\" he said, \"I suppose you know you don't\nlook in the least like a lady's maid? You look like a disguised\nprincess.\"\n\nShe laughed.",
        "\"That's very nice of you, Mr. Marson, but you're quite wrong.\nAnyone could tell I was a lady's maid, a mile away. You aren't\ncriticizing the dress, surely?\"\n\n\"The dress is all right. It's the general effect. I don't think\nyour expression is right. It's--it's--there's too much attack in\nit. You aren't meek enough.\"\n\nJoan's eyes opened wide.\n\n\"Meek! Have you ever seen an English lady's maid, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"Why, no; now that I come to think of it, I don't believe I\nhave.\"",
        "\"Well, let me tell you that meekness is her last quality. Why\nshould she be meek? Doesn't she go in after the groom of the\nchambers?\"\n\n\"Go in? Go in where?\"\n\n\"In to dinner.\" She smiled at the sight of his bewildered face.\n\"I'm afraid you don't know much about the etiquette of the new\nworld you have entered so rashly. Didn't you know that the rules\nof precedence among the servants of a big house in England are\nmore rigid and complicated than in English society?\"\n\n\"You're joking!\"",
        "\"I'm not joking. You try going in to dinner out of your proper\nplace when we get to Blandings and see what happens. A public\nrebuke from the butler is the least you could expect.\"\n\nA bead of perspiration appeared on Ashe's forehead.\n\n\"Heavens!\" he whispered. \"If a butler publicly rebuked me I think\nI should commit suicide. I couldn't survive it.\"\n\nHe stared, with fallen jaw, into the abyss of horror into which\nhe had leaped so light-heartedly. The servant problem, on this",
        "large scale, had been nonexistent for him until now. In the days\nof his youth, at Mayling, Massachusetts, his needs had been\nministered to by a muscular Swede. Later, at Oxford, there had\nbeen his \"scout\" and his bed maker, harmless persons both,\nprovided you locked up your whisky. And in London, his last\nphase, a succession of servitors of the type of the disheveled\nmaid at Number Seven had tended him.\n\nThat, dotted about the land of his adoption, there were houses in",
        "which larger staffs of domestics were maintained, he had been\nvaguely aware. Indeed, in \"Gridley Quayle, Investigator; the\nAdventure of the Missing Marquis\"--number four of the series--he\nhad drawn a picture of the home life of a duke, in which a butler\nand two powdered footmen had played their parts; but he had had\nno idea that rigid and complicated rules of etiquette swayed the\nprivate lives of these individuals. If he had given the matter a",
        "thought he had supposed that when the dinner hour arrived the\nbutler and the two footmen would troop into the kitchen and\nsquash in at the table wherever they found room.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said. \"Tell me all you know. I feel as though I had\nescaped a frightful disaster.\"\n\n\"You probably have. I don't suppose there is anything so terrible\nas a snub from a butler.\"\n\n\"If there is I can't think of it. When I was at Oxford I used to\ngo and stay with a friend of mine who had a butler that looked",
        "like a Roman emperor in swallowtails. He terrified me. I used to\ngrovel to the man. Please give me all the pointers you can.\"\n\n\"Well, as Mr. Peters' valet, I suppose you will be rather a big\nman.\"\n\n\"I shan't feel it.\"\n\n\"However large the house party is, Mr. Peters is sure to be the\nprincipal guest; so your standing will be correspondingly\nmagnificent. You come after the butler, the housekeeper, the\ngroom of the chambers, Lord Emsworth's valet, Lady Ann\nWarblington's lady's maid--\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"",
        "\"Lady Ann? Lord Emsworth's sister. She has lived with him since\nhis wife died. What was I saying? Oh, yes! After them come the\nhonorable Frederick Threepwood's valet and myself--and then you.\"\n\n\"I'm not so high up then, after all?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. There's a whole crowd who come after you. It all\ndepends on how many other guests there are besides Mr. Peters.\"\n\n\"I suppose I charge in at the head of a drove of housemaids and\nscullery maids?\"",
        "\"My dear Mr. Marson, if a housemaid or a scullery maid tried to\nget into the steward's room and have her meals with us, she would\nbe--\"\n\n\"Rebuked by the butler?\"\n\n\"Lynched, I should think. Kitchen maids and scullery maids eat in\nthe kitchen. Chauffeurs, footmen, under-butler, pantry boys, hall\nboy, odd man and steward's-room footman take their meals in the\nservants' hall, waited on by the hall boy. The stillroom maids\nhave breakfast and tea in the stillroom, and dinner and supper in",
        "the hall. The housemaids and nursery maids have breakfast and tea\nin the housemaid's sitting-room, and dinner and supper in the\nhall. The head housemaid ranks next to the head stillroom maid.\nThe laundry maids have a place of their own near the laundry, and\nthe head laundry maid ranks above the head housemaid. The chef\nhas his meals in a room of his own near the kitchen. Is there\nanything else I can tell you, Mr. Marson?\"\n\nAshe was staring at her with vacant eyes. He shook his head\ndumbly.",
        "\"We stop at Swindon in half an hour,\" said Joan softly. \"Don't\nyou think you would be wise to get out there and go straight back\nto London, Mr. Marson? Think of all you would avoid!\"\n\nAshe found speech.\n\n\"It's a nightmare!\"\n\n\"You would be far happier in Arundell Street. Why don't you get\nout at Swindon and go back?\"\n\nAshe shook his head.\n\n\"I can't. There's--there's a reason.\"\n\nJoan picked up her magazine again. Hostility had come out from",
        "the corner into which she had tucked it away and was once more\nfilling her mind. She knew it was illogical, but she could not\nhelp it. For a moment, during her revelations of servants'\netiquette, she had allowed herself to hope that she had\nfrightened her rival out of the field, and the disappointment\nmade her feel irritable. She buried herself in a short story, and\ncountered Ashe's attempts at renewing the conversation with cold\nmonosyllables, until he ceased his efforts and fell into a moody",
        "silence.\n\nHe was feeling hurt and angry. Her sudden coldness, following on\nthe friendliness with which she had talked so long, puzzled and\ninfuriated him. He felt as though he had been snubbed, and for no\nreason.\n\nHe resented the defensive magazine, though he had bought it for\nher himself. He resented her attitude of having ceased to\nrecognize his existence. A sadness, a filmy melancholy, crept\nover him. He brooded on the unutterable silliness of humanity,",
        "especially the female portion of it, in erecting artificial\nbarriers to friendship. It was so unreasonable.\n\nAt their first meeting, when she might have been excused for\nshowing defensiveness, she had treated him with unaffected ease.\nWhen that meeting had ended there was a tacit understanding\nbetween them that all the preliminary awkwardnesses of the first\nstages of acquaintanceship were to be considered as having been\npassed; and that when they met again, if they ever did, it would",
        "be as friends. And here she was, luring him on with apparent\nfriendliness, and then withdrawing into herself as though he had\npresumed.\n\nA rebellious spirit took possession of him. He didn't care! Let\nher be cold and distant. He would show her that she had no\nmonopoly of those qualities. He would not speak to her until she\nspoke to him; and when she spoke to him he would freeze her with\nhis courteous but bleakly aloof indifference.",
        "The train rattled on. Joan read her magazine. Silence reigned in\nthe second-class compartment. Swindon was reached and passed.\nDarkness fell on the land. The journey began to seem interminable\nto Ashe; but presently there came a creaking of brakes and the\ntrain jerked itself to another stop. A voice on the platform made\nitself heard, calling:\n\n\"Market Blandings! Market Blandings Station!\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe village of Market Blandings is one of those sleepy English",
        "hamlets that modern progress has failed to touch; except by the\naddition of a railroad station and a room over the grocer's shop\nwhere moving pictures are on view on Tuesdays and Fridays. The\nchurch is Norman and the intelligence of the majority of the\nnatives Paleozoic. To alight at Market Blandings Station in the\ndusk of a rather chilly Spring day, when the southwest wind has\nshifted to due east and the thrifty inhabitants have not yet lit",
        "their windows, is to be smitten with the feeling that one is at\nthe edge of the world with no friends near.\n\nAshe, as he stood beside Mr. Peters' baggage and raked the\nunsympathetic darkness with a dreary eye, gave himself up to\nmelancholy. Above him an oil lamp shed a meager light. Along the\nplatform a small but sturdy porter was juggling with a milk can.\nThe east wind explored Ashe's system with chilly fingers.\n\nSomewhere out in the darkness into which Mr. Peters and Aline had",
        "already vanished in a large automobile, lay the castle, with its\nbutler and its fearful code of etiquette. Soon the cart that was\nto convey him and the trunks thither would be arriving. He\nshivered.\n\nOut of the gloom and into the feeble rays of the oil lamp came\nJoan Valentine. She had been away, tucking Aline into the car.\nShe looked warm and cheerful. She was smiling in the old friendly\nway.\n\nIf girls realized their responsibilities they would be so careful",
        "when they smiled that they would probably abandon the practice\naltogether. There are moments in a man's life when a girl's smile\ncan have as important results as an explosion of dynamite.\n\nIn the course of their brief acquaintance Joan had smiled at Ashe\nmany times, but the conditions governing those occasions had not\nbeen such as to permit him to be seriously affected. He had been\npleased on such occasions; he had admired her smile in a detached",
        "and critical spirit; but he had not been overwhelmed by it. The\nframe of mind necessary for that result had been lacking.\n\nNow, however, after five minutes of solitude on the depressing\nplatform of Market Blandings Station, he was what the\nspiritualists call a sensitive subject. He had reached that depth\nof gloom and bodily discomfort when a sudden smile has all the\neffect of strong liquor and good news administered\nsimultaneously, warming the blood and comforting the soul, and",
        "generally turning the world from a bleak desert into a land\nflowing with milk and honey.\n\nIt is not too much to say that he reeled before Joan's smile. It\nwas so entirely unexpected. He clutched Mr. Peters' steamer trunk\nin his emotion. All his resolutions to be cold and distant were\nswept away. He had the feeling that in a friendless universe here\nwas somebody who was fond of him and glad to see him.\n\nA smile of such importance demands analysis, and in this case",
        "repays it; for many things lay behind this smile of Joan\nValentine's on the platform of Market Blandings Station.\n\nIn the first place, she had had another of her swift changes of\nmood, and had once again tucked away hostility into its corner.\nShe had thought it over and had come to the conclusion that as\nshe had no logical grievance against Ashe for anything he had\ndone to be distant to him was the behavior of a cat. Consequently\nshe resolved, when they should meet again, to resume her attitude",
        "of good-fellowship. That in itself would have been enough to make\nher smile.\n\nThere was another reason, however, which had nothing to do with\nAshe. While she had been tucking Aline into the automobile she\nmet the eye of the driver of that vehicle and had perceived a\ncurious look in it--a look of amazement and sheer terror. A\nmoment, later, when Aline called the driver Freddie, she had\nunderstood. No wonder the Honorable Freddie had looked as though\nhe had seen a ghost.",
        "It would be a relief to the poor fellow when, as he undoubtedly\nwould do in the course of the drive, he inquired of Aline the\nname of her maid and was told that it was Simpson. He would\nmutter something about \"Reminds me of a girl I used to know,\" and\nwould brood on the remarkable way in which Nature produces\ndoubles. But he had a bad moment, and it was partly at the\nrecollection of his face that Joan smiled.\n\nA third reason was because the sight of the Honorable Freddie had",
        "reminded her that R. Jones had said he had written her poetry.\nThat thought, too, had contributed toward the smile which so\ndazzled Ashe.\n\nAshe, not being miraculously intuitive, accepted the easier\nexplanation that she smiled because she was glad to be in his\ncompany; and this thought, coming on top of his mood of despair\nand general dissatisfaction with everything mundane, acted on him\nlike some powerful chemical.\n\nIn every man's life there is generally one moment to which in",
        "later years he can look back and say: \"In this moment I fell in\nlove!\" Such a moment came to Ashe now.\n\n          Betwixt the stirrup and the ground,\n          Mercy I asked; mercy I found.\n\nSo sings the poet and so it was with Ashe.\n\nIn the almost incredibly brief time it took the small but sturdy\nporter to roll a milk can across the platform and hump it, with a\nclang, against other milk cans similarly treated a moment before,\nAshe fell in love.",
        "The word is so loosely used, to cover a thousand varying shades\nof emotion--from the volcanic passion of an Antony for a\nCleopatra to the tepid preference of a grocer's assistant for the\nIrish maid at the second house on Main Street, as opposed to the\nNorwegian maid at the first house past the post office--the mere\nstatement that Ashe fell in love is not a sufficient description\nof his feelings as he stood grasping Mr. Peters' steamer trunk.\nAnalysis is required.",
        "From his fourteenth year onward Ashe had been in love many times.\nHis sensations in the case of Joan were neither the terrific\nupheaval that had caused him, in his fifteenth year, to collect\ntwenty-eight photographs of the heroine of the road company of a\nmusical comedy which had visited the Hayling Opera House, nor the\nmilder flame that had caused him, when at college, to give up\nsmoking for a week and try to read the complete works of Ella\nWheeler Wilcox.",
        "His love was something that lay between these two poles.\n\nHe did not wish the station platform of Market Blandings to\nbecome suddenly congested with red Indians so that he might save\nJoan's life; and he did not wish to give up anything at all. But\nhe was conscious--to the very depths of his being--that a future\nin which Joan did not figure would be so insupportable as not to\nbear considering; and in the immediate present he very strongly",
        "favored the idea of clasping Joan in his arms and kissing her\nuntil further notice.\n\nMingled with these feelings was an excited gratitude to her for\ncoming to him like this, with that electric smile on her face; a\nstunned realization that she was a thousand times prettier than\nhe had ever imagined; and a humility that threatened to make him\nloose his clutch on the steamer trunk and roll about at her feet,\nyapping like a dog.\n\nGratitude, so far as he could dissect his tangled emotion was the",
        "predominating ingredient of his mood. Only once in his life had\nhe felt so passionately grateful to any human being. On that\noccasion, too, the object of his gratitude had been feminine.\n\nYears before, when a boy in his father's home in distant Hayling,\nMassachusetts, those in authority had commanded that he--in his\neleventh year and as shy as one can be only at that interesting\nage--should rise in the presence of a roomful of strangers, adult\nguests, and recite \"The Wreck of the Hesperus.\"",
        "He had risen. He had blushed. He had stammered. He had contrived\nto whisper: \"It was the Schooner Hesperus.\" And then, in a corner\nof the room, a little girl, for no properly explained reason, had\nburst out crying. She had yelled, she had bellowed, and would not\nbe comforted; and in the ensuing confusion Ashe had escaped to\nthe woodpile at the bottom of the garden, saved by a miracle.\n\nAll his life he had remembered the gratitude he had felt for that",
        "little timely girl, and never until now had he experienced any\nother similar spasm. But as he looked at Joan he found himself\nrenewing that emotion of fifteen years ago.\n\nShe was about to speak. In a sort of trance he watched her lips\npart. He waited almost reverently for the first words she should\nspeak to him in her new role of the only authentic goddess.\n\n\"Isn't it a shame?\" she said. \"I've just put a penny in the\nchocolate slot machine--and it's empty! I've a good mind to write",
        "to the company.\"\n\nAshe felt as though he were listening to the strains of some\ngrand sweet anthem.\n\nThe small but sturdy porter, weary of his work among the milk\ncans, or perhaps--let us not do him an injustice even in\nthought--having finished it, approached them.\n\n\"The cart from the castle's here.\"\n\nIn the gloom beyond him there gleamed a light which had not been\nthere before. The meditative snort of a horse supported his\nstatement. He began to deal as authoritatively with Mr. Peters'",
        "steamer trunk as he had dealt with the milk cans.\n\n\"At last!\" said Joan. \"I hope it's a covered cart. I'm frozen.\nLet's go and see.\"\n\nAshe followed her with the gait of an automaton.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nCold is the ogre that drives all beautiful things into hiding.\nBelow the surface of a frost-bound garden there lurk hidden\nbulbs, which are only biding their time to burst forth in a riot\nof laughing color; but shivering Nature dare not put forth her",
        "flowers until the ogre has gone. Not otherwise does cold suppress\nlove. A man in an open cart on an English Spring night may\ncontinue to be in love; but love is not the emotion uppermost in\nhis bosom. It shrinks within him and waits for better times.\n\nThe cart was not a covered cart. It was open to the four winds of\nheaven, of which the one at present active proceeded from the\nbleak east. To this fact may be attributed Ashe's swift recovery",
        "from the exalted mood into which Joan's smile had thrown him, his\nalmost instant emergence from the trance. Deep down in him he was\naware that his attitude toward Joan had not changed, but his\nconscious self was too fully occupied with the almost hopeless\ntask of keeping his blood circulating, to permit of thoughts of\nlove. Before the cart had traveled twenty yards he was a mere\nchunk of frozen misery.\n\nAfter an eternity of winding roads, darkened cottages, and black",
        "fields and hedges, the cart turned in at a massive iron gate,\nwhich stood open giving entrance to a smooth gravel drive. Here\nthe way ran for nearly a mile through an open park of great trees\nand was then swallowed in the darkness of dense shrubberies.\nPresently to the left appeared lights, at first in ones and twos,\nshining out and vanishing again; then, as the shrubberies ended\nand the smooth lawns and terraces began, blazing down on the",
        "travelers from a score of windows, with the heartening effect of\nfires on a winter night.\n\nAgainst the pale gray sky Blandings Castle stood out like a\nmountain. It was a noble pile, of Early Tudor building. Its\nhistory is recorded in England's history books and Viollet-le-Duc\nhas written of its architecture. It dominated the surrounding\ncountry.\n\nThe feature of it which impressed Ashe most at this moment,\nhowever, was the fact that it looked warm; and for the first time",
        "since the drive began he found himself in a mood that\napproximated cheerfulness. It was a little early to begin feeling\ncheerful, he discovered, for the journey was by no means over.\nArrived within sight of the castle, the cart began a detour,\nwhich, ten minutes later, brought it under an arch and over\ncobblestones to the rear of the building, where it eventually\npulled up in front of a great door.\n\nAshe descended painfully and beat his feet against the cobbles.",
        "He helped Joan to climb down. Joan was apparently in a gentle\nglow. Women seem impervious to cold.\n\nThe door opened. Warm, kitcheny scents came through it. Strong\nmen hurried out to take down the trunks, while fair women, in the\nshape of two nervous scullery maids, approached Joan and Ashe,\nand bobbed curtsies. This under more normal conditions would have\nbeen enough to unman Ashe; but in his frozen state a mere\ncurtsying scullery maid expended herself harmlessly on him. He",
        "even acknowledged the greeting with a kindly nod.\n\nThe scullery maids, it seemed, were acting in much the same\ncapacity as the attaches of royalty. One was there to conduct\nJoan to the presence of Mrs. Twemlow, the housekeeper; the other\nto lead Ashe to where Beach, the butler, waited to do honor to\nthe valet of the castle's most important guest.\n\nAfter a short walk down a stone-flagged passage Joan and her\nescort turned to the right. Ashe's objective appeared to be",
        "located to the left. He parted from Joan with regret. Her moral\nsupport would have been welcome.\n\nPresently his scullery maid stopped at a door and tapped thereon.\nA fruity voice, like old tawny port made audible, said: \"Come\nin!\" Ashe's guide opened the door.\n\n\"The gentleman, Mr. Beach,\" said she, and scuttled away to the\nless rarefied atmosphere of the kitchen.\n\nAshe's first impression of Beach, the butler, was one of tension.\nOther people, confronted for the first time with Beach, had felt",
        "the same. He had that strained air of being on the very point of\nbursting that one sees in bullfrogs and toy balloons. Nervous and\nimaginative men, meeting Beach, braced themselves involuntarily,\nstiffening their muscles for the explosion. Those who had the\npleasure of more intimate acquaintance with him soon passed this\nstage, just as people whose homes are on the slopes of Mount\nVesuvius become immune to fear of eruptions.\n\nAs far back as they could remember Beach had always looked as",
        "though an apoplectic fit were a matter of minutes; but he never\nhad apoplexy and in time they came to ignore the possibility of\nit. Ashe, however, approaching him with a fresh eye, had the\nfeeling that this strain could not possibly continue and that\nwithin a very short space of time the worst must happen. The\nprospect of this did much to rouse him from the coma into which\nhe had been frozen by the rigors of the journey.\n\nButlers as a class seem to grow less and less like anything human",
        "in proportion to the magnificence of their surroundings. There is\na type of butler employed in the comparatively modest homes of\nsmall country gentlemen who is practically a man and a brother;\nwho hobnobs with the local tradesmen, sings a good comic song at\nthe village inn, and in times of crisis will even turn to and\nwork the pump when the water supply suddenly fails.\n\nThe greater the house the more does the butler diverge from this",
        "type. Blandings Castle was one of the more important of England's\nshow places, and Beach accordingly had acquired a dignified\ninertia that almost qualified him for inclusion in the vegetable\nkingdom. He moved--when he moved at all--slowly. He distilled\nspeech with the air of one measuring out drops of some precious\ndrug. His heavy-lidded eyes had the fixed expression of a\nstatue's.\n\nWith an almost imperceptible wave of a fat white hand, he",
        "conveyed to Ashe that he desired him to sit down. With a stately\nmovement of his other hand, he picked up a kettle, which simmered\non the hob. With an inclination of his head, he called Ashe's\nattention to a decanter on the table.\n\nIn another moment Ashe was sipping a whisky toddy, with the\nfeeling that he had been privileged to assist at some mystic\nrite. Mr. Beach, posting himself before the fire and placing his\nhands behind his back, permitted speech to drip from him.",
        "\"I have not the advantage of your name, Mr.----\"\n\nAshe introduced himself. Beach acknowledged the information with\na half bow.\n\n\"You must have had a cold ride, Mr. Marson. The wind is in the\neast.\"\n\nAshe said yes; the ride had been cold.\n\n\"When the wind is in the east,\" continued Mr. Beach, letting each\nsyllable escape with apparent reluctance, \"I suffer from my\nfeet.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"I suffer from my feet,\" repeated the butler, measuring out the",
        "drops. \"You are a young man, Mr. Marson. Probably you do not know\nwhat it is to suffer from your feet.\" He surveyed Ashe, his\nwhisky toddy and the wall beyond him, with heavy-lidded\ninscrutability. \"Corns!\" he said.\n\nAshe said he was sorry.\n\n\"I suffer extremely from my feet--not only corns. I have but\nrecently recovered from an ingrowing toenail. I suffered greatly\nfrom my ingrowing toenail. I suffer from swollen joints.\"\n\nAshe regarded this martyr with increasing disfavor. It is the",
        "flaw in the character of many excessively healthy young men that,\nthough kind-hearted enough in most respects, they listen with a\nregrettable feeling of impatience to the confessions of those\nless happily situated as regards the ills of the flesh. Rightly\nor wrongly, they hold that these statements should be reserved\nfor the ear of the medical profession, and other and more general\ntopics selected for conversation with laymen.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said hastily. \"You must have had a bad time. Is",
        "there a large house party here just now?\"\n\n\"We are expecting,\" said Mr. Beach, \"a number of guests. We shall\nin all probability sit down thirty or more to dinner.\"\n\n\"A responsibility for you,\" said Ashe ingratiatingly, well\npleased to be quit of the feet topic.\n\nMr. Beach nodded.\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Marson. Few persons realize the\nresponsibilities of a man in my position. Sometimes, I can assure\nyou, it preys on my mind, and I suffer from nervous headaches.\"",
        "Ashe began to feel like a man trying to put out a fire which, as\nfast as he checks it at one point, breaks out at another.\n\n\"Sometimes when I come off duty everything gets blurred. The\noutlines of objects grow indistinct and misty. I have to sit down\nin a chair. The pain is excruciating.\"\n\n\"But it helps you to forget the pain in your feet.\"\n\n\"No, no. I suffer from my feet simultaneously.\"\n\nAshe gave up the struggle.\n\n\"Tell me all about your feet,\" he said.",
        "And Mr. Beach told him all about his feet.\n\nThe pleasantest functions must come to an end, and the moment\narrived when the final word on the subject of swollen joints was\nspoken. Ashe, who had resigned himself to a permanent\ncontemplation of the subject, could hardly believe he heard\ncorrectly when, at the end of some ten minutes, his companion\nchanged the conversation.\n\n\"You have been with Mr. Peters some time, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh! Oh, no only since last Wednesday.\"",
        "\"Indeed! Might I inquire whom you assisted before that?\"\n\nFor a moment Ashe did what he would not have believed himself\ncapable of doing--regretted that the topic of feet was no longer\nunder discussion. The question placed him in an awkward position.\nIf he lied and credited himself with a lengthy experience as a\nvalet, he risked exposing himself. If he told the truth and\nconfessed that this was his maiden effort in the capacity of\ngentleman's gentleman, what would the butler think? There were",
        "objections to each course, but to tell the truth was the easier\nof the two; so he told it.\n\n\"Your first situation?\" said Mr. Beach. \"Indeed!\"\n\n\"I was--er--doing something else before I met Mr. Peters,\" said\nAshe.\n\nMr. Beach was too well-bred to be inquisitive, but his eyebrows\nwere not.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. \"?\" cried his eyebrows. \"?--?--?\"\n\nAshe ignored the eyebrows.\n\n\"Something different,\" he said.\n\nThere was an awkward silence. Ashe appreciated its awkwardness.",
        "He was conscious of a grievance against Mr. Peters. Why could not\nMr. Peters have brought him down here as his secretary? To be\nsure, he had advanced some objection to that course in their\nconversation at the offices of Mainprice, Mainprice & Boole; but\nmerely a silly, far-fetched objection. He wished he had had the\nsense to fight the point while there was time; but at the moment\nwhen they were arranging plans he had been rather tickled by the",
        "thought of becoming a valet. The notion had a pleasing\nmusical-comedy touch about it. Why had he not foreseen the\ncomplications that must ensue? He could tell by the look on his\nface that this confounded butler was waiting for him to give a\nfull explanation. What would he think if he withheld it? He would\nprobably suppose that Ashe had been in prison.\n\nWell, there was nothing to be done about it. If Beach was\nsuspicious, he must remain suspicious. Fortunately the suspicions",
        "of a butler do not matter much.\n\nMr. Beach's eyebrows were still mutely urging him to reveal all,\nbut Ashe directed his gaze at that portion of the room which Mr.\nBeach did not fill. He would be hanged if he was going to let\nhimself be hypnotized by a pair of eyebrows into incriminating\nhimself! He glared stolidly at the pattern of the wallpaper,\nwhich represented a number of birds of an unknown species seated\non a corresponding number of exotic shrubs.",
        "The silence was growing oppressive. Somebody had to break it\nsoon. And as Mr. Beach was still confining himself to the\nlanguage of the eyebrow and apparently intended to fight it out\non that line if it took all Summer, Ashe himself broke it.\n\nIt seemed to him as he reconstructed the scene in bed that night\nthat Providence must have suggested the subject to Mr. Peters'\nindigestion; for the mere mention of his employer's sufferings\nacted like magic on the butler.",
        "\"I might have had better luck while I was looking for a place,\"\nsaid Ashe. \"I dare say you know how bad-tempered Mr. Peters is.\nHe is dyspeptic.\"\n\n\"So,\" responded Mr. Beach, \"I have been informed.\" He brooded for\na space. \"I, too,\" he proceeded, \"suffer from my stomach. I have\na weak stomach. The lining of my stomach is not what I could wish\nthe lining of my stomach to be.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Ashe gratefully, leaning forward in an attitude\nof attention, \"all about the lining of your stomach.\"",
        "It was a quarter of an hour later when Mr. Beach was checked in\nhis discourse by the chiming of the little clock on the\nmantelpiece. He turned round and gazed at it with surprise not\nunmixed with displeasure.\n\n\"So late?\" he said. \"I shall have to be going about my duties.\nAnd you, also, Mr. Marson, if I may make the suggestion. No doubt\nMr. Peters will be wishing to have your assistance in preparing\nfor dinner. If you go along the passage outside you will come to",
        "the door that separates our portion of the house from the other.\nI must beg you to excuse me. I have to go to the cellar.\"\n\nFollowing his directions Ashe came after a walk of a few yards to\na green-baize door, which, swinging at his push, gave him a view\nof what he correctly took to be the main hall of the castle--a\nwide, comfortable space, ringed with settees and warmed by a log\nfire burning in a mammoth fireplace. On the right a broad\nstaircase led to the upper regions.",
        "It was at this point that Ashe realized the incompleteness of Mr.\nBeach's directions. Doubtless, the broad staircase would take him\nto the floor on which were the bedrooms; but how was he to\nascertain, without the tedious process of knocking and inquiring\nat each door, which was the one assigned to Mr. Peters? It was\ntoo late to go back and ask the butler for further guidance;\nalready he was on his way to the cellar in quest of the evening's\nwine.",
        "As he stood irresolute a door across the hall opened and a man of\nhis own age came out. Through the doorway, which the young man\nheld open for an instant while he answered a question from\nsomebody within, Ashe had a glimpse of glass-topped cases.\n\nCould this be the museum--his goal? The next moment the door,\nopening a few inches more, revealed the outlying portions of an\nEgyptian mummy and brought certainty. It flashed across Ashe's\nmind that the sooner he explored the museum and located Mr.",
        "Peters' scarab, the better. He decided to ask Beach to take him\nthere as soon as he had leisure.\n\nMeantime the young man had closed the museum door and was\ncrossing the hall. He was a wiry-haired, severe-looking young\nman, with a sharp nose and eyes that gleamed through rimless\nspectacles--none other, in fact than Lord Emsworth's private\nsecretary, the Efficient Baxter. Ashe hailed him:\n\n\"I say, old man, would you mind telling me how I get to Mr.\nPeters' room? I've lost my bearings.\"",
        "He did not reflect that this was hardly the way in which valets\nin the best society addressed their superiors. That is the worst\nof adopting what might be called a character part. One can manage\nthe business well enough; it is the dialogue that provides the\npitfalls.\n\nMr. Baxter would have accorded a hearty agreement to the\nstatement that this was not the way in which a valet should have\nspoken to him; but at the moment he was not aware that Ashe was a",
        "valet. From his easy mode of address he assumed that he was one\nof the numerous guests who had been arriving at the castle all\nday. As he had asked for Mr. Peters, he fancied that Ashe must be\nthe Honorable Freddie's American friend, George Emerson, whom he\nhad not yet met. Consequently he replied with much cordiality\nthat Mr. Peters' room was the second at the left on the second\nfloor.\n\nHe said Ashe could not miss it. Ashe said he was much obliged.\n\n\"Awfully good of you,\" said Ashe.",
        "\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Baxter.\n\n\"You lose your way in a place like this,\" said Ashe.\n\n\"You certainly do,\" said Mr. Baxter.\n\nAshe went on his upward path and in a few moments was knocking at\nthe door indicated. And sure enough it was Mr. Peters' voice that\ninvited him to enter.\n\nMr. Peters, partially arrayed in the correct garb for gentlemen\nabout to dine, was standing in front of the mirror, wrestling\nwith his evening tie. As Ashe entered he removed his fingers and",
        "anxiously examined his handiwork. It proved unsatisfactory. With\na yelp and an oath, he tore the offending linen from his neck.\n\n\"Damn the thing!\"\n\nIt was plain to Ashe that his employer was in no sunny mood.\nThere are few things less calculated to engender sunniness in a\nnaturally bad-tempered man than a dress tie that will not let\nitself be pulled and twisted into the right shape. Even when\nthings went well, Mr. Peters hated dressing for dinner. Words",
        "cannot describe his feelings when they went wrong.\n\nThere is something to be said in excuse for this impatience: It\nis a hollow mockery to be obliged to deck one's person as for a\nfeast when that feast is to consist of a little asparagus and a\nfew nuts.\n\nMr. Peters' eye met Ashe's in the mirror.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, is it? Come in, then. Don't stand staring. Close\nthat door quick! Hustle! Don't scrape your feet on the floor.\nTry to look intelligent. Don't gape. Where have you been all this",
        "while? Why didn't you come before? Can you tie a tie? All right,\nthen--do it!\"\n\nSomewhat calmed by the snow-white butterfly-shaped creation that\ngrew under Ashe's fingers, he permitted himself to be helped into\nhis coat. He picked up the remnant of a black cigar from the\ndressing-table and relit it.\n\n\"I've been thinking about you,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Ashe.\n\n\"Have you located the scarab yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What the devil have you been doing with yourself then? You've",
        "had time to collar it a dozen times.\"\n\n\"I have been talking to the butler.\"\n\n\"What the devil do you waste time talking to butlers for? I\nsuppose you haven't even located the museum yet?\"\n\n\"Yes; I've done that.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have, have you? Well, that's something. And how do you\npropose setting about the job?\"\n\n\"The best plan would be to go there very late at night.\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't propose to stroll in in the afternoon, did you?\nHow are you going to find the scarab when you do get in?\"",
        "Ashe had not thought of that. The deeper he went into this\nbusiness the more things did there seem to be in it of which he\nhad not thought.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he confessed.\n\n\"You don't know! Tell me, young man, are you considered pretty\nbright, as Englishmen go?\"\n\n\"I am not English. I was born near Boston.\"\n\n\"Oh, you were, were you? You blanked bone-headed, bean-eating\nboob!\" cried Mr. Peters, frothing over quite unexpectedly and\nwaving his arms in a sudden burst of fury. \"Then if you are an",
        "American why don't you show a little more enterprise? Why don't\nyou put something over? Why do you loaf about the place as though\nyou were supposed to be an ornament? I want results--and I want\nthem quick!\n\n\"I'll tell you how you can recognize my scarab when you get into\nthe museum. That shameless old green-goods man who sneaked it\nfrom me has had the gall, the nerve, to put it all by itself,\nwith a notice as big as a circus poster alongside of it saying",
        "that it is a Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty, presented\"--Mr. Peters\nchoked--\"presented by J. Preston Peters, Esquire! That's how\nyou're going to recognize it.\"\n\nAshe did not laugh, but he nearly dislocated a rib in his effort\nto abstain from doing so. It seemed to him that this act on Lord\nEmsworth's part effectually disposed of the theory that Britons\nhave no sense of humor. To rob a man of his choicest possession\nand then thank him publicly for letting you have it appealed to",
        "Ashe as excellent comedy.\n\n\"The thing isn't even in a glass case,\" continued Mr. Peters.\n\"It's lying on an open tray on top of a cabinet of Roman coins.\nAnybody who was left alone for two minutes in the place could\ntake it! It's criminal carelessness to leave a valuable scarab\nabout like that. If Lord Jesse James was going to steal my Cheops\nhe might at least have had the decency to treat it as though it\nwas worth something.\"\n\n\"But it makes it easier for me to get it,\" said Ashe consolingly.",
        "\"It's got to be made easy if you are to get it!\" snapped Mr.\nPeters. \"Here's another thing: You say you are going to try for\nit late at night. Well, what are you going to do if anyone\ncatches you prowling round at that time? Have you considered\nthat?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You would have to say something, wouldn't you? You wouldn't chat\nabout the weather, would you? You wouldn't discuss the latest\nplay? You would have to think up some mighty good reason for\nbeing out of bed at that time, wouldn't you?\"",
        "\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do admit that, do you? Well, what you would say is this:\nYou would explain that I had rung for you to come and read me to\nsleep. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"You think that would be a satisfactory explanation of my being\nin the museum?\"\n\n\"Idiot! I don't mean that you're to say it if you're caught\nactually in the museum. If you're caught in the museum the best\nthing you can do is to say nothing, and hope that the judge will",
        "let you off light because it's your first offense. You're to say\nit if you're found wandering about on your way there.\"\n\n\"It sounds thin to me.\"\n\n\"Does it? Well, let me tell you that it isn't so thin as you\nsuppose, for it's what you will actually have to do most nights.\nTwo nights out of three I have to be read to sleep. My\nindigestion gives me insomnia.\" As though to push this fact home,\nMr. Peters suddenly bent double. \"Oof!\" he said. \"Wow!\" He",
        "removed the cigar from his mouth and inserted a digestive\ntabloid. \"The lining of my stomach is all wrong,\" he added.\n\nIt is curious how trivial are the immediate causes that produce\nrevolutions. If Mr. Peters had worded his complaint differently\nAshe would in all probability have borne it without active\nprotest. He had been growing more and more annoyed with this\nlittle person who buzzed and barked and bit at him, yet the idea\nof definite revolt had not occurred to him. But his sufferings at",
        "the hands of Beach, the butler, had reduced him to a state where\nhe could endure no further mention of stomachic linings. There\ncomes a time when our capacity for listening to detailed data\nabout the linings of other people's stomachs is exhausted.\n\nHe looked at Mr. Peters sternly. He had ceased to be intimidated\nby the fiery little man and regarded him simply as a\nhypochondriac, who needed to be told a few useful facts.\n\n\"How do you expect not to have indigestion? You take no exercise",
        "and you smoke all day long.\"\n\nThe novel sensation of being criticized--and by a beardless youth\nat that--held Mr. Peters silent. He started convulsively, but he\ndid not speak. Ashe, on his pet subject, became eloquent. In his\nopinion dyspeptics cumbered the earth. To his mind they had the\nchoice between health and sickness, and they deliberately chose\nthe latter.\n\n\"Your sort of man makes me angry. I know your type inside out.\nYou overwork and shirk exercise, and let your temper run away",
        "with you, and smoke strong cigars on an empty stomach; and when\nyou get indigestion as a natural result you look on yourself as a\nmartyr, nourish a perpetual grouch, and make the lives of\neverybody you meet miserable. If you would put yourself into my\nhands for a month I would have you eating bricks and thriving on\nthem. Up in the morning, Larsen Exercises, cold bath, a brisk\nrubdown, sharp walk--\"\n\n\"Who the devil asked your opinion, you impertinent young hound?\"\ninquired Mr. Peters.",
        "\"Don't interrupt--confound you!\" shouted Ashe. \"Now you have made\nme forget what I was going to say.\"\n\nThere was a tense silence. Then Mr. Peters began to speak:\n\n\"You--infernal--impudent--\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me like that!\"\n\n\"I'll talk to you just--\"\n\nAshe took a step toward the door. \"Very well, then,\" he said.\n\"I'll quit! I'm through! You can get somebody else to do this job\nof yours for you.\"\n\nThe sudden sagging of Mr. Peters' jaw, the look of consternation",
        "that flashed on his face, told Ashe he had found the right\nweapon--that the game was in his hands. He continued with a\nfeeling of confidence:\n\n\"If I had known what being your valet involved I wouldn't have\nundertaken the thing for a hundred thousand dollars. Just because\nyou had some idiotic prejudice against letting me come down here\nas your secretary, which would have been the simple and obvious\nthing, I find myself in a position where at any moment I may be",
        "publicly rebuked by the butler and have the head stillroom maid\nlooking at me as though I were something the cat had brought in.\"\n\nHis voice trembled with self-pity.\n\n\"Do you realize a fraction of the awful things you have let me in\nfor? How on earth am I to remember whether I go in before the\nchef or after the third footman? I shan't have a peaceful minute\nwhile I'm in this place. I've got to sit and listen by the hour\nto a bore of a butler who seems to be a sort of walking hospital.",
        "I've got to steer my way through a complicated system of\netiquette.\n\n\"And on top of all that you have the nerve, the insolence, to\nimagine that you can use me as a punching bag to work your bad\ntemper off! You have the immortal rind to suppose that I will\nstand for being nagged and bullied by you whenever your suicidal\nway of living brings on an attack of indigestion! You have the\nsupreme gall to fancy that you can talk as you please to me!",
        "\"Very well! I've had enough of it. I resign! If you want this\nscarab of yours recovered let somebody else do it. I've retired\nfrom business.\"\n\nHe took another step toward the door. A shaking hand clutched at\nhis sleeve.\n\n\"My boy--my dear boy--be reasonable!\"\n\nAshe was intoxicated with his own oratory. The sensation of\nbullyragging a genuine millionaire was new and exhilarating. He\nexpanded his chest and spread his feet like a colossus.",
        "\"That's all very well,\" he said, coldly disentangling himself\nfrom the hand. \"You can't get out of it like that. We have got to\ncome to an understanding. The point is that if I am to be\nsubjected to your--your senile malevolence every time you have a\ntwinge of indigestion, no amount of money could pay me to stop\non.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, it shall not occur again. I was hasty.\"\n\nMr. Peters, with agitated fingers, relit the stump of his cigar.\n\n\"Throw away that cigar!\"\n\n\"My boy!\"",
        "\"Throw it away! You say you were hasty. Of course you were hasty;\nand as long as you abuse your digestion you will go on being\nhasty. I want something better than apologies. If I am to stop\nhere we must get to the root of things. You must put yourself in\nmy hands as though I were your doctor. No more cigars. Every\nmorning regular exercises.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\n\"No; stop! Stop! What sort of exercises?\"\n\n\"I'll show you to-morrow morning. Brisk walks.\"\n\n\"I hate walking.\"\n\n\"Cold baths.\"",
        "\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\n\"No; stop! A cold bath would kill me at my age.\"\n\n\"It would put new life into you. Do you consent to the cold\nbaths? No? Very well!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"You promise?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"All right, then.\"\n\nThe distant sound of the dinner gong floated in.\n\n\"We settled that just in time,\" said Ashe.\n\nMr. Peters regarded him fixedly.\n\n\"Young man,\" he said slowly, \"if, after all this, you fail to\nrecover my Cheops for me I'll--I'll--By George, I'll skin you!\"",
        "\"Don't talk like that,\" said Ashe. \"That's another thing you have\ngot to remember. If my treatment is to be successful you must not\nlet yourself think in that way. You must exercise self-control\nmentally. You must think beautiful thoughts.\"\n\n\"The idea of skinning you is a beautiful thought!\" said Mr.\nPeters wistfully.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIn order that their gayety might not be diminished--and the food\nturned to ashes in their mouths by the absence from the festive",
        "board of Mr. Beach, it was the custom for the upper servants at\nBlandings to postpone the start of their evening meal until\ndinner was nearly over above-stairs. This enabled the butler to\ntake his place at the head of the table without fear of\ninterruption, except for the few moments when coffee was being\nserved.\n\nEvery night shortly before half-past eight--at which hour Mr.\nBeach felt that he might safely withdraw from the dining-room and",
        "leave Lord Emsworth and his guests to the care of Merridew, the\nunder-butler, and James and Alfred, the footmen, returning only\nfor a few minutes to lend tone and distinction to the\ndistribution of cigars and liqueurs--those whose rank entitled\nthem to do so made their way to the housekeeper's room, to pass\nin desultory conversation the interval before Mr. Beach should\narrive, and a kitchen maid, with the appearance of one who has\nbeen straining at the leash and has at last managed to get free,",
        "opened the door, with the announcement: \"Mr. Beach, if you please,\ndinner is served.\" On which Mr. Beach, extending a crooked elbow\ntoward the housekeeper, would say, \"Mrs. Twemlow!\" and lead the\nway, high and disposedly, down the passage, followed in order of\nrank by the rest of the company, in couples, to the steward's\nroom.\n\nFor Blandings was not one of those houses--or shall we say\nhovels?--where the upper servants are expected not only to feed",
        "but to congregate before feeding in the steward's room. Under the\nauspices of Mr. Beach and of Mrs. Twemlow, who saw eye to eye\nwith him in these matters, things were done properly at the\ncastle, with the correct solemnity. To Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow\nthe suggestion that they and their peers should gather together\nin the same room in which they were to dine would have been as\nrepellent as an announcement from Lady Ann Warblington, the",
        "chatelaine, that the house party would eat in the drawing-room.\n\nWhen Ashe, returning from his interview with Mr. Peters, was\nintercepted by a respectful small boy and conducted to the\nhousekeeper's room, he was conscious of a sensation of shrinking\ninferiority akin to his emotions on his first day at school. The\nroom was full and apparently on very cordial terms with itself.\nEverybody seemed to know everybody and conversation was\nproceeding in a manner reminiscent of an Old Home Week.",
        "As a matter of fact, the house party at Blandings being in the\nmain a gathering together of the Emsworth clan by way of honor\nand as a means of introduction to Mr. Peters and his daughter,\nthe bride-of-the-house-to-be, most of the occupants of the\nhousekeeper's room were old acquaintances and were renewing\ninterrupted friendships at the top of their voices.\n\nA lull followed Ashe's arrival and all eyes, to his great\ndiscomfort, were turned in his direction. His embarrassment was",
        "relieved by Mrs. Twemlow, who advanced to do the honors. Of Mrs.\nTwemlow little need be attempted in the way of pen portraiture\nbeyond the statement that she went as harmoniously with Mr.\nBeach as one of a pair of vases or one of a brace of pheasants\ngoes with its fellow. She had the same appearance of imminent\napoplexy, the same air of belonging to some dignified and haughty\nbranch of the vegetable kingdom.\n\n\"Mr. Marson, welcome to Blandings Castle!\"",
        "Ashe had been waiting for somebody to say this, and had been a\nlittle surprised that Mr. Beach had not done so. He was also\nsurprised at the housekeeper's ready recognition of his identity,\nuntil he saw Joan in the throng and deduced that she must have\nbeen the source of information.\n\nHe envied Joan. In some amazing way she contrived to look not out\nof place in this gathering. He himself, he felt, had impostor\nstamped in large characters all over him.",
        "Mrs. Twemlow began to make the introductions--a long and tedious\nprocess, which she performed relentlessly, without haste and\nwithout scamping her work. With each member of the aristocracy of\nhis new profession Ashe shook hands, and on each member he\nsmiled, until his facial and dorsal muscles were like to crack\nunder the strain. It was amazing that so many high-class\ndomestics could be collected into one moderate-sized room.\n\n\"Miss Simpson you know,\" said Mrs. Twemlow, and Ashe was about to",
        "deny the charge when he perceived that Joan was the individual\nreferred to. \"Mr. Judson, Mr. Marson. Mr. Judson is the Honorable\nFrederick's gentleman.\"\n\n\"You have not the pleasure of our Freddie's acquaintance as yet,\nI take it, Mr. Marson?\" observed Mr. Judson genially, a\nsmooth-faced, lazy-looking young man. \"Freddie repays\ninspection.\"\n\n\"Mr. Marson, permit me to introduce you to Mr. Ferris, Lord\nStockheath's gentleman.\"\n\nMr. Ferris, a dark, cynical man, with a high forehead, shook Ashe",
        "by the hand.\n\n\"Happy to meet you, Mr. Marson.\"\n\n\"Miss Willoughby, this is Mr. Marson, who will take you in to\ndinner. Miss Willoughby is Lady Mildred Mant's lady. As of course\nyou are aware, Lady Mildred, our eldest daughter, married Colonel\nHorace Mant, of the Scots Guards.\"\n\nAshe was not aware, and he was rather surprised that Mrs. Twemlow\nshould have a daughter whose name was Lady Mildred; but reason,\ncoming to his rescue, suggested that by our she meant the",
        "offspring of the Earl of Emsworth and his late countess. Miss\nWilloughby was a light-hearted damsel, with a smiling face and\nchestnut hair, done low over her forehead.\n\nSince etiquette forbade that he should take Joan in to dinner,\nAshe was glad that at least an apparently pleasant substitute had\nbeen provided. He had just been introduced to an appallingly\nstatuesque lady of the name of Chester, Lady Ann Warblington's\nown maid, and his somewhat hazy recollections of Joan's lecture",
        "on below-stairs precedence had left him with the impression that\nthis was his destined partner. He had frankly quailed at the\nprospect of being linked to so much aristocratic hauteur.\n\nWhen the final introduction had been made conversation broke out\nagain. It dealt almost exclusively, so far as Ashe could follow\nit, with the idiosyncrasies of the employers of those present. He\ntook it that this happened down the entire social scale below\nstairs. Probably the lower servants in the servants' hall",
        "discussed the upper servants in the room, and the still lower\nservants in the housemaids' sitting-room discussed their\nsuperiors of the servants' hall, and the stillroom gossiped about\nthe housemaids' sitting-room.\n\nHe wondered which was the bottom circle of all, and came to the\nconclusion that it was probably represented by the small\nrespectful boy who had acted as his guide a short while before.\nThis boy, having nobody to discuss anybody with, presumably sat",
        "in solitary meditation, brooding on the odd-job man.\n\nHe thought of mentioning this theory to Miss Willoughby, but\ndecided that it was too abstruse for her, and contented himself\nwith speaking of some of the plays he had seen before leaving\nLondon. Miss Willoughby was an enthusiast on the drama; and,\nColonel Mant's military duties keeping him much in town, she had\nhad wide opportunities of indulging her tastes. Miss Willoughby\ndid not like the country. She thought it dull.",
        "\"Don't you think the country dull, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"I shan't find it dull here,\" said Ashe; and he was surprised to\ndiscover, through the medium of a pleased giggle, that he was\nconsidered to have perpetrated a compliment.\n\nMr. Beach appeared in due season, a little distrait, as becomes a\nman who has just been engaged on important and responsible\nduties.\n\n\"Alfred spilled the hock!\" Ashe heard him announce to Mrs.\nTwemlow in a bitter undertone. \"Within half an inch of his",
        "lordship's arm he spilled it.\"\n\nMrs. Twemlow murmured condolences. Mr. Beach's set expression was\nof one who is wondering how long the strain of existence can be\nsupported.\n\n\"Mr. Beach, if you please, dinner is served.\"\n\nThe butler crushed down sad thoughts and crooked his elbow.\n\n\"Mrs. Twemlow!\"\n\nAshe, miscalculating degrees of rank in spite of all his caution,\nwas within a step of leaving the room out of his proper turn; but\nthe startled pressure of Miss Willoughby's hand on his arm warned",
        "him in time. He stopped, to allow the statuesque Miss Chester to\nsail out under escort of a wizened little man with a horseshoe\npin in his tie, whose name, in company with nearly all the others\nthat had been spoken to him since he came into the room, had\nescaped Ashe's memory.\n\n\"You were nearly making a bloomer!\" said Miss Willoughby\nbrightly. \"You must be absent-minded, Mr. Marson--like his\nlordship.\"\n\n\"Is Lord Emsworth absent-minded?\"\n\nMiss Willoughby laughed.",
        "\"Why, he forgets his own name sometimes! If it wasn't for Mr.\nBaxter, goodness knows what would happen to him.\"\n\n\"I don't think I know Mr. Baxter.\"\n\n\"You will if you stay here long. You can't get away from him if\nyou're in the same house. Don't tell anyone I said so; but he's\nthe real master here. His lordship's secretary he calls himself;\nbut he's really everything rolled into one--like the man in the\nplay.\"\n\nAshe, searching in his dramatic memories for such a person in a",
        "play, inquired whether Miss Willoughby meant Pooh-Bah, in \"The\nMikado,\" of which there had been a revival in London recently.\nMiss Willoughby did mean Pooh-Bah.\n\n\"But Nosy Parker is what I call him,\" she said. \"He minds\neverybody's business as well as his own.\"\n\nThe last of the procession trickled into the steward's room.\nMr. Beach said grace somewhat patronizingly. The meal began.\n\n\"You've seen Miss Peters, of course, Mr. Marson?\" said Miss\nWilloughby, resuming conversation with the soup.",
        "\"Just for a few minutes at Paddington.\"\n\n\"Oh! You haven't been with Mr. Peters long, then?\"\n\nAshe began to wonder whether everybody he met was going to ask\nhim this dangerous question.\n\n\"Only a day or so.\"\n\n\"Where were you before that?\"\n\nAshe was conscious of a prickly sensation. A little more of this\nand he might as well reveal his true mission at the castle and\nhave done with it.\n\n\"Oh, I was--that is to say----\"\n\n\"How are you feeling after the journey, Mr. Marson?\" said a voice",
        "from the other side of the table; and Ashe, looking up\ngratefully, found Joan's eyes looking into his with a curiously\namused expression.\n\nHe was too grateful for the interruption to try to account for\nthis. He replied that he was feeling very well, which was not the\ncase. Miss Willoughby's interest was diverted to a discussion of\nthe defects of the various railroad systems of Great Britain.\n\nAt the head of the table Mr. Beach had started an intimate",
        "conversation with Mr. Ferris, the valet of Lord Stockheath, the\nHonorable Freddie's \"poor old Percy\"--a cousin, Ashe had\ngathered, of Aline Peters' husband-to-be. The butler spoke in\nmore measured tones even than usual, for he was speaking of\ntragedy.\n\n\"We were all extremely sorry, Mr. Ferris, to read of your\nmisfortune.\"\n\nAshe wondered what had been happening to Mr. Ferris.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Beach,\" replied the valet, \"it's a fact we made a\npretty poor show.\" He took a sip from his glass. \"There is no",
        "concealing the fact--I have never tried to conceal it--that poor\nPercy is not bright.\"\n\nMiss Chester entered the conversation.\n\n\"I couldn't see where the girl--what's her name? was so very\npretty. All the papers had pieces where it said she was\nattractive, and what not; but she didn't look anything special to\nme from her photograph in the Mirror. What his lordship could see\nin her I can't understand.\"\n\n\"The photo didn't quite do her justice, Miss Chester. I was",
        "present in court, and I must admit she was svelte--decidedly\nsvelte. And you must recollect that Percy, from childhood up, has\nalways been a highly susceptible young nut. I speak as one who\nknows him.\"\n\nMr. Beach turned to Joan.\n\n\"We are speaking of the Stockheath breach-of-promise case, Miss\nSimpson, of which you doubtless read in the newspapers. Lord\nStockheath is a nephew of ours. I fancy his lordship was greatly\nshocked at the occurrence.\"",
        "\"He was,\" chimed in Mr. Judson from down the table. \"I happened\nto overhear him speaking of it to young Freddie. It was in the\nlibrary on the morning when the judge made his final summing up\nand slipped it into Lord Stockheath so proper. 'If ever anything\nof this sort happens to you, you young scalawag,' he says to\nFreddie--\"\n\nMr. Beach coughed. \"Mr. Judson!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right, Mr. Beach; we're all in the family here, in\na manner of speaking. It wasn't as though I was telling it to a",
        "lot of outsiders. I'm sure none of these ladies or gentlemen\nwill let it go beyond this room?\"\n\nThe company murmured virtuous acquiescence.\n\n\"He says to Freddie: 'You young scalawag, if ever anything of\nthis sort happens to you, you can pack up and go off to Canada,\nfor I'll have nothing more to do with you!'--or words to that\neffect. And Freddie says: 'Oh, dash it all, gov'nor, you\nknow--what?'\"\n\nHowever short Mr. Judson's imitation of his master's voice may",
        "have fallen of histrionic perfection, it pleased the company. The\nroom shook with mirth.\n\n\"Mr. Judson is clever, isn't he, Mr. Marson?\" whispered Miss\nWilloughby, gazing with adoring eyes at the speaker.\n\nMr. Beach thought it expedient to deflect the conversation. By\nthe unwritten law of the room every individual had the right to\nspeak as freely as he wished about his own personal employer; but\nJudson, in his opinion, sometimes went a trifle too far.",
        "\"Tell me, Mr. Ferris,\" he said, \"does his lordship seem to bear\nit well?\"\n\n\"Oh, Percy is bearing it well enough.\"\n\nAshe noted as a curious fact that, though the actual valet of any\nperson under discussion spoke of him almost affectionately by his\nChristian name, the rest of the company used the greatest\nceremony and gave him his title with all respect. Lord Stockheath\nwas Percy to Mr. Ferris, and the Honorable Frederick Threepwood\nwas Freddie to Mr. Judson; but to Ferris, Mr. Judson's Freddie",
        "was the Honorable Frederick, and to Judson Mr. Ferris' Percy was\nLord Stockheath. It was rather a pleasant form of etiquette, and\nstruck Ashe as somehow vaguely feudal.\n\n\"Percy,\" went on Mr. Ferris, \"is bearing it like a little\nBriton--the damages not having come out of his pocket! It's his\nold father--who had to pay them--that's taking it to heart. You\nmight say he's doing himself proud. He says it's brought on his\ngout again, and that's why he's gone to Droitwich instead of",
        "coming here. I dare say Percy isn't sorry.\"\n\n\"It has been,\" said Mr. Beach, summing up, \"a most unfortunate\noccurrence. The modern tendency of the lower classes to get above\nthemselves is becoming more marked every day. The young female in\nthis case was, I understand, a barmaid. It is deplorable that our\nyoung men should allow themselves to get into such\nentanglements.\"\n\n\"The wonder to me,\" said the irrepressible Mr. Judson, \"is that",
        "more of these young chaps don't get put through it. His lordship\nwasn't so wide of the mark when he spoke like that to Freddie in\nthe library that time. I give you my word, it's a mercy young\nFreddie hasn't been up against it! When we were in London,\nFreddie and I,\" he went on, cutting through Mr. Beach's\ndisapproving cough, \"before what you might call the crash, when\nhis lordship cut off supplies and had him come back and live\nhere, Freddie was asking for it--believe me! Fell in love with a",
        "girl in the chorus of one of the theaters. Used to send me to the\nstage door with notes and flowers every night for weeks, as\nregular as clockwork.\n\n\"What was her name? It's on the tip of my tongue. Funny how you\nforget these things! Freddie was pretty far gone. I recollect\nonce, happening to be looking round his room in his absence,\ncoming on a poem he had written to her. It was hot stuff--very\nhot! If that girl has kept those letters it's my belief we shall",
        "see Freddie following in Lord Stockheath's footsteps.\"\n\nThere was a hush of delighted horror round the table.\n\n\"Goo',\" said Miss Chester's escort with unction. \"You don't say\nso, Mr. Judson! It wouldn't half make them look silly if the\nHonorable Frederick was sued for breach just now, with the\nwedding coming on!\"\n\n\"There is no danger of that.\"\n\nIt was Joan's voice, and she had spoken with such decision that\nshe had the ear of the table immediately. All eyes looked in her",
        "direction. Ashe was struck with her expression. Her eyes were\nshining as though she were angry; and there was a flush on her\nface. A phrase he had used in the train came back to him. She\nlooked like a princess in disguise.\n\n\"What makes you say that, Miss Simpson?\" inquired Judson,\nannoyed. He had been at pains to make the company's flesh creep,\nand it appeared to be Joan's aim to undo his work.\n\nIt seemed to Ashe that Joan made an effort of some sort as though",
        "she were pulling herself together and remembering where she was.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, almost lamely, \"I don't think it at all likely\nthat he proposed marriage to this girl.\"\n\n\"You never can tell,\" said Judson. \"My impression is that Freddie\ndid. It's my belief that there's something on his mind these\ndays. Before he went to London with his lordship the other day he\nwas behaving very strange. And since he came back it's my belief\nthat he has been brooding. And I happen to know he followed the",
        "affair of Lord Stockheath pretty closely, for he clipped the\nclippings out of the paper. I found them myself one day when I\nhappened to be going through his things.\"\n\nBeach cleared his throat--his mode of indicating that he was\nabout to monopolize the conversation.\n\n\"And in any case, Miss Simpson,\" he said solemnly, \"with things\ncome to the pass they have come to, and the juries--drawn from\nthe lower classes--in the nasty mood they're in, it don't seem",
        "hardly necessary in these affairs for there to have been any\ndefinite promise of marriage. What with all this socialism\nrampant, they seem so happy at the idea of being able to do one\nof us an injury that they give heavy damages without it. A few\nardent expressions, and that's enough for them. You recollect the\nHavant case, and when young Lord Mount Anville was sued? What it\ncomes to is that anarchy is getting the upper hand, and the lower",
        "classes are getting above themselves. It's all these here cheap\nnewspapers that does it. They tempt the lower classes to get\nabove themselves.\n\n\"Only this morning I had to speak severe to that young fellow,\nJames, the footman. He was a good young fellow once and did his\nwork well, and had a proper respect for people; but now he's gone\nall to pieces. And why? Because six months ago he had the\nrheumatism, and had the audacity to send his picture and a",
        "testimonial, saying that it had cured him of awful agonies, to\nWalkinshaw's Supreme Ointment, and they printed it in half a\ndozen papers; and it has been the ruin of James. He has got above\nhimself and don't care for nobody.\"\n\n\"Well, all I can say is,\" resumed Judson, \"that I hope to\ngoodness nothing won't happen to Freddie of that kind; for it's\nnot every girl that would have him.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of assent to this truth.\n\n\"Now your Miss Peters,\" said Judson tolerantly--\"she seems a nice",
        "little thing.\"\n\n\"She would be pleased to hear you say so,\" said Joan.\n\n\"Joan Valentine!\" cried Judson, bringing his hands down on the\ntablecloth with a bang. \"I've just remembered it. That was the\nname of the girl Freddie used to write the letters and poems to;\nand that's who it is I've been trying all along to think you\nreminded me of, Miss Simpson. You're the living image of\nFreddie's Miss Joan Valentine.\"\n\nAshe was not normally a young man of particularly ready wit; but",
        "on this occasion it may have been that the shock of this\nrevelation, added to the fact that something must be done\nspeedily if Joan's discomposure was not to become obvious to all\npresent, quickened his intelligence. Joan, usually so sure of\nherself, so ready of resource, had gone temporarily to pieces.\nShe was quite white, and her eyes met Ashe's with almost a hunted\nexpression.\n\nIf the attention of the company was to be diverted, something",
        "drastic must be done. A mere verbal attempt to change the\nconversation would be useless. Inspiration descended on Ashe.\n\nIn the days of his childhood in Hayling, Massachusetts, he had\nplayed truant from Sunday school again and again in order to\nfrequent the society of one Eddie Waffles, the official bad boy\nof the locality. It was not so much Eddie's charm of conversation\nwhich had attracted him--though that had been great--as the fact\nthat Eddie, among his other accomplishments, could give a",
        "lifelike imitation of two cats fighting in a back yard; and Ashe\nfelt that he could never be happy until he had acquired this gift\nfrom the master.\n\nIn course of time he had done so. It might be that his absences\nfrom Sunday school in the cause of art had left him in later\nyears a trifle shaky on the subject of the Kings of Judah, but\nhis hard-won accomplishment had made him in request at every\nsmoking concert at Oxford; and it saved the situation now.",
        "\"Have you ever heard two cats fighting in a back yard?\" he\ninquired casually of his neighbor, Miss Willoughby.\n\nThe next moment the performance was in full swing. Young Master\nWaffles, who had devoted considerable study to his subject, had\nconceived the combat of his imaginary cats in a broad, almost\nHomeric, vein. The unpleasantness opened with a low gurgling\nsound, answered by another a shade louder and possibly more\nquerulous. A momentary silence was followed by a long-drawn note,",
        "like rising wind, cut off abruptly and succeeded by a grumbling\nmutter. The response to this was a couple of sharp howls. Both\nparties to the contest then indulged in a discontented whining,\ngrowing louder and louder until the air was full of electric\nmenace. And then, after another sharp silence, came war, noisy\nand overwhelming.\n\nStanding at Master Waffles' side, you could follow almost every\nmovement of that intricate fray, and mark how now one and now the",
        "other of the battlers gained a short-lived advantage. It was a\ngreat fight. Shrewd blows were taken and given, and in the eye of\nthe imagination you could see the air thick with flying fur.\nLouder and louder grew the din; and then, at its height, it\nceased in one crescendo of tumult, and all was still, save for a\nfaint, angry moaning.\n\nSuch was the cat fight of Master Eddie Waffles; and Ashe, though\nfalling short of the master, as a pupil must, rendered it\nfaithfully and with energy.",
        "To say that the attention of the company was diverted from Mr.\nJudson and his remarks by the extraordinary noises which\nproceeded from Ashe's lips would be to offer a mere shadowy\nsuggestion of the sensation caused by his efforts. At first,\nstunned surprise, then consternation, greeted him. Beach, the\nbutler, was staring as one watching a miracle, nearer apparently\nto apoplexy than ever. On the faces of the others every shade of\nemotion was to be seen.",
        "That this should be happening in the steward's room at Blandings\nCastle was scarcely less amazing than if it had taken place in a\ncathedral. The upper servants, rigid in their seats, looked at\neach other, like Cortes' soldiers--\"with a wild surmise.\"\n\nThe last faint moan of feline defiance died away and silence fell\non the room. Ashe turned to Miss Willoughby.\n\n\"Just like that!\" he said. \"I was telling Miss Willoughby,\" he\nadded apologetically to Mrs. Twemlow, \"about the cats in London.",
        "They were a great trial.\"\n\nFor perhaps three seconds his social reputation swayed to and fro\nin the balance, while the company pondered on what he had done.\nIt was new; but it was humorous--or was it vulgar? There is\nnothing the English upper servant so abhors as vulgarity. That\nwas what the steward's room was trying to make up its mind about.\n\nThen Miss Willoughby threw her shapely head back and the squeal\nof her laughter smote the ceiling. And at that the company made",
        "its decision. Everybody laughed. Everybody urged Ashe to give an\nencore. Everybody was his friend and admirer---everybody but\nBeach, the butler. Beach, the butler, was shocked to his very\ncore. His heavy-lidded eyes rested on Ashe with disapproval. It\nseemed to Beach, the butler, that this young man Marson had got\nabove himself.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nAshe found Joan at his side. Dinner was over and the diners were\nmaking for the housekeeper's room.",
        "\"Thank you, Mr. Marson. That was very good of you and very\nclever.\" Her eyes twinkled. \"But what a terrible chance you took!\nYou have made yourself a popular success, but you might just as\neasily have become a social outcast. As it is, I am afraid Mr.\nBeach did not approve.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he didn't. In a minute or so I'm going to fawn on him\nand make all well.\"\n\nJoan lowered her voice.\n\n\"It was quite true, what that odious little man said. Freddie",
        "Threepwood did write me letters. Of course I destroyed them long\nago.\"\n\n\"But weren't you running the risk in coming here that he might\nrecognize you? Wouldn't that make it rather unpleasant for you?\"\n\n\"I never met him, you see. He only wrote to me. When he came to\nthe station to meet us this evening he looked startled to see me;\nso I suppose he remembers my appearance. But Aline will have told\nhim that my name is Simpson.\"\n\n\"That fellow Judson said he was brooding. I think you ought to",
        "put him out of his misery.\"\n\n\"Mr. Judson must have been letting his imagination run away with\nhim. He is out of his misery. He sent a horrid fat man named\nJones to see me in London about the letters, and I told him I had\ndestroyed them. He must have let him know that by this time.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nThey went into the housekeeper's room. Mr. Beach was standing\nbefore the fire. Ashe went up to him. It was not an easy matter\nto mollify Mr. Beach. Ashe tried the most tempting topics. He",
        "mentioned swollen feet--he dangled the lining of Mr. Beach's\nstomach temptingly before his eyes; but the butler was not to be\nsoftened. Only when Ashe turned the conversation to the subject\nof the museum did a flicker of animation stir him.\n\nMr. Beach was fond and proud of the Blandings Castle museum. It\nhad been the means of getting him into print for the first and\nonly time in his life. A year before, a representative of the\nIntelligencer and Echo, from the neighboring town of Blatchford,",
        "had come to visit the castle on behalf of his paper; and he had\nbegun one section of his article with the words: \"Under the\nauspices of Mr. Beach, my genial cicerone, I then visited his\nlordship's museum--\" Mr. Beach treasured the clipping in a\nspecial writing-desk.\n\nHe responded almost amiably to Ashe's questions. Yes; he had seen\nthe scarab--he pronounced it scayrub--which Mr. Peters had\npresented to his lordship. He understood that his lordship",
        "thought very highly of Mr. Peters' scayrub. He had overheard Mr.\nBaxter telling his lordship that it was extremely valuable.\n\n\"Mr. Beach,\" said Ashe, \"I wonder whether you would take me to\nsee Lord Emsworth's museum?\"\n\nMr. Beach regarded him heavily.\n\n\"I shall be pleased to take you to see his lordship's museum,\" he\nreplied.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nOne can attribute only to the nervous mental condition following\nthe interview he had had with Ashe in his bedroom the rash act",
        "Mr. Peters attempted shortly after dinner.\n\nMr. Peters, shortly after dinner, was in a dangerous and reckless\nmood. He had had a wretched time all through the meal. The\nBlandings chef had extended himself in honor of the house party,\nand had produced a succession of dishes, which in happier days\nMr. Peters would have devoured eagerly. To be compelled by\nconsiderations of health to pass these by was enough to damp the\nliveliest optimist. Mr. Peters had suffered terribly. Occasions",
        "of feasting and revelry like the present were for him so many\nbattlefields, on which greed fought with prudence.\n\nAll through dinner he brooded on Ashe's defiance and the horrors\nwhich were to result from that defiance. One of Mr. Peters' most\npainful memories was of a two weeks' visit he had once paid to\nMr. Muldoon in his celebrated establishment at White Plains. He\nhad been persuaded to go there by a brother millionaire whom,\nuntil then, he had always regarded as a friend. The memory of Mr.",
        "Muldoon's cold shower baths and brisk system of physical exercise\nstill lingered.\n\nThe thought that under Ashe's rule he was to go through privately\nvery much what he had gone through in the company of a gang of\nother unfortunates at Muldoon's froze him with horror. He knew\nthose health cranks who believed that all mortal ailments could\nbe cured by cold showers and brisk walks. They were all alike and\nthey nearly killed you. His worst nightmare was the one where he",
        "dreamed he was back at Muldoon's, leading his horse up that\nendless hill outside the village.\n\nHe would not stand it! He would be hanged if he'd stand it! He\nwould defy Ashe. But if he defied Ashe, Ashe would go away; and\nthen whom could he find to recover his lost scarab?\n\nMr. Peters began to appreciate the true meaning of the phrase\nabout the horns of a dilemma. The horns of this dilemma occupied\nhis attention until the end of the dinner. He shifted uneasily",
        "from one to the other and back again. He rose from the table in a\nthoroughly overwrought condition of mind. And then, somehow, in\nthe course of the evening, he found himself alone in the hall,\nnot a dozen feet from the unlocked museum door.\n\nIt was not immediately that he appreciated the significance of\nthis fact. He had come to the hall because its solitude suited\nhis mood. It was only after he had finished a cigar--Ashe could\nnot stop his smoking after dinner--that it suddenly flashed on",
        "him that he had ready at hand a solution of all his troubles. A\nbrief minute's resolute action and the scarab would be his again,\nand the menace of Ashe a thing of the past. He glanced about him.\nYes; he was alone.\n\nNot once since the removal of the scarab had begun to exercise\nhis mind had Mr. Peters contemplated for an instant the\npossibility of recovering it himself. The prospect of the\nunpleasantness that would ensue had been enough to make him",
        "regard such an action as out of the question. The risk was too\ngreat to be considered for a moment; but here he was, in a\nposition where the risk was negligible!\n\nLike Ashe, he had always visualized the recovery of his scarab as\na thing of the small hours, a daring act to be performed when\nsleep held the castle in its grip. That an opportunity would be\npresented to him of walking in quite calmly and walking out again\nwith the Cheops in his pocket, had never occurred to him as a\npossibility.",
        "Yet now this chance was presenting itself in all its simplicity,\nand all he had to do was to grasp it. The door of the museum was\nnot even closed. He could see from where he stood that it was\najar.\n\nHe moved cautiously in its direction--not in a straight line as\none going to a museum, but circuitously as one strolling without\nan aim. From time to time he glanced over his shoulder. He\nreached the door, hesitated, and passed it. He turned, reached",
        "the door again--and again passed it. He stood for a moment\ndarting his eyes about the hall; then, in a burst of resolution,\nhe dashed for the door and shot in like a rabbit.\n\nAt the same moment the Efficient Baxter, who, from the shelter of\na pillar on the gallery that ran around two-thirds of the hall,\nhad been eyeing the peculiar movements of the distinguished guest\nwith considerable interest for some minutes, began to descend the\nstairs.",
        "Rupert Baxter, the Earl of Emsworth's indefatigable private\nsecretary, was one of those men whose chief characteristic is a\nvague suspicion of their fellow human beings. He did not suspect\nthem of this or that definite crime; he simply suspected them. He\nprowled through life as we are told the hosts of Midian prowled.\n\nHis powers in this respect were well-known at Blandings Castle.\nThe Earl of Emsworth said: \"Baxter is invaluable--positively",
        "invaluable.\" The Honorable Freddie said: \"A chappie can't take a\nstep in this bally house without stumbling over that damn feller,\nBaxter!\" The manservant and the maidservant within the gates,\nlike Miss Willoughby, employing that crisp gift for\ncharacterization which is the property of the English lower\norders, described him as a Nosy Parker.\n\nPeering over the railing of the balcony and observing the curious\nmovements of Mr. Peters, who, as a matter of fact, while making",
        "up his mind to approach the door, had been backing and filling\nabout the hall in a quaint serpentine manner like a man trying to\ninvent a new variety of the tango, the Efficient Baxter had found\nhimself in some way--why, he did not know--of what, he could not\nsay--but in some nebulous way, suspicious.\n\nHe had not definitely accused Mr. Peters in his mind of any\nspecific tort or malfeasance. He had merely felt that something\nfishy was toward. He had a sixth sense in such matters.",
        "But when Mr. Peters, making up his mind, leaped into the museum,\nBaxter's suspicions lost their vagueness and became crystallized.\nCertainty descended on him like a bolt from the skies. On oath,\nbefore a notary, the Efficient Baxter would have declared that J.\nPreston Peters was about to try to purloin the scarab.\n\nLest we should seem to be attributing too miraculous powers of\nintuition to Lord Emsworth's secretary, it should be explained",
        "that the mystery which hung about that curio had exercised his\nmind not a little since his employer had given it to him to place\nin the museum. He knew Lord Emsworth's power of forgetting and he\ndid not believe his account of the transaction. Scarab maniacs\nlike Mr. Peters did not give away specimens from their\ncollections as presents. But he had not divined the truth of what\nhad happened in London.\n\nThe conclusion at which he had arrived was that Lord Emsworth had",
        "bought the scarab and had forgotten all about it. To support this\ntheory was the fact that the latter had taken his check book to\nLondon with him. Baxter's long acquaintance with the earl had\nleft him with the conviction that there was no saying what he\nmight not do if left loose in London with a check book.\n\nAs to Mr. Peters' motive for entering the museum, that, too,\nseemed completely clear to the secretary. He was a curio\nenthusiast himself and he had served collectors in a secretarial",
        "capacity; and he knew, both from experience and observation, that\nstrange madness which may at any moment afflict the collector,\nblotting out morality and the nice distinction between meum and\ntuum, as with a sponge. He knew that collectors who would not\nsteal a loaf if they were starving might--and did--fall before\nthe temptation of a coveted curio.\n\nHe descended the stairs three at a time, and entered the museum\nat the very instant when Mr. Peters' twitching fingers were about",
        "to close on his treasure. He handled the delicate situation with\neminent tact. Mr. Peters, at the sound of his step, had executed a\nbackward leap, which was as good as a confession of guilt, and\nhis face was rigid with dismay; but the Efficient Baxter\npretended not to notice these phenomena. His manner, when he\nspoke, was easy and unembarrassed.\n\n\"Ah! Taking a look at our little collection, Mr. Peters? You will\nsee that we have given the place of honor to your Cheops. It is",
        "certainly a fine specimen--a wonderfully fine specimen.\"\n\nMr. Peters was recovering slowly. Baxter talked on, to give him\ntime. He spoke of Mut and Bubastis, of Ammon and the Book of the\nDead. He directed the other's attention to the Roman coins.\n\nHe was touching on some aspects of the Princess Gilukhipa of\nMitanni, in whom his hearer could scarcely fail to be interested,\nwhen the door opened and Beach, the butler, came in, accompanied",
        "by Ashe. In the bustle of the interruption Mr. Peters escaped,\nglad to be elsewhere, and questioning for the first time in his\nlife the dictum that if you want a thing well done you must do it\nyourself.\n\n\"I was not aware, sir,\" said Beach, the butler, \"that you were in\noccupation of the museum. I would not have intruded; but this\nyoung man expressed a desire to examine the exhibits, and I took\nthe liberty of conducting him.\"\n\n\"Come in, Beach--come in,\" said Baxter.",
        "The light fell on Ashe's face, and he recognized him as the\ncheerful young man who had inquired the way to Mr. Peters' room\nbefore dinner and who, he had by this time discovered, was not\nthe Honorable Freddie's friend, George Emerson--or, indeed, any\nother of the guests of the house. He felt suspicious.\n\n\"Oh, Beach!\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Just a moment.\"\n\nHe drew the butler into the hall, out of earshot.\n\n\"Beach, who is that man?\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters' valet, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters' valet!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"",
        "\"Has he been in service long?\" asked Baxter, remembering that a\nmere menial had addressed him as \"old man.\"\n\nBeach lowered his voice. He and the Efficient Baxter were old\nallies, and it seemed right to Beach to confide in him.\n\n\"He has only just joined Mr. Peters, sir; and he has never been\nin service before. He told me so himself, and I was unable to\nelicit from him any information as to his antecedents. His manner\nstruck me, sir, as peculiar. It crossed my mind to wonder whether",
        "Mr. Peters happened to be aware of this. I should dislike to do\nany young man an injury; but it might be anyone coming to a\ngentleman without a character, like this young man. Mr. Peters\nmight have been deceived, sir.\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter's manner became distraught. His mind was\nworking rapidly.\n\n\"Should he be informed, sir?\"\n\n\"Eh! Who?\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters, sir--in case he should have been deceived?\"\n\n\"No, no; Mr. Peters knows his own business.\"\n\n\"Far from me be it to appear officious, sir; but--\"",
        "\"Mr. Peters probably knows all about him. Tell me, Beach, who was\nit suggested this visit to the museum? Did you?\"\n\n\"It was at the young man's express desire that I conducted him,\nsir.\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter returned to the museum without a word.\nAshe, standing in the middle of the room, was impressing the\ntopography of the place on his memory. He was unaware of the\npiercing stare of suspicion that was being directed at him from\nbehind.",
        "He did not see Baxter. He was not even thinking of Baxter; but\nBaxter was on the alert. Baxter was on the warpath. Baxter knew!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAmong the compensations of advancing age is a wholesome\npessimism, which, though it takes the fine edge off of whatever\ntriumphs may come to us, has the admirable effect of preventing\nFate from working off on us any of those gold bricks, coins with\nstrings attached, and unhatched chickens, at which ardent youth",
        "snatches with such enthusiasm, to its subsequent disappointment.\nAs we emerge from the twenties we grow into a habit of mind that\nlooks askance at Fate bearing gifts. We miss, perhaps, the\noccasional prize, but we also avoid leaping light-heartedly into\ntraps.\n\nAshe Marson had yet to reach the age of tranquil mistrust; and\nwhen Fate seemed to be treating him kindly he was still young\nenough to accept such kindnesses on their face value and rejoice\nat them.",
        "As he sat on his bed at the end of his first night in Castle\nBlandings, he was conscious to a remarkable degree that Fortune\nwas treating him well. He had survived--not merely without\ndiscredit, but with positive triumph--the initiatory plunge into\nthe etiquette maelstrom of life below stairs. So far from doing\nthe wrong thing and drawing down on himself the just scorn of the\nsteward's room, he had been the life and soul of the party. Even",
        "if to-morrow, in an absent-minded fit, he should anticipate the\ngroom of the chambers in the march to the table, he would be\nforgiven; for the humorist has his privileges.\n\nSo much for that. But that was only a part of Fortune's\nkindnesses. To have discovered on the first day of their\nassociation the correct method of handling and reducing to\nsubjection his irascible employer was an even greater boon. A\nprolonged association with Mr. Peters on the lines in which their",
        "acquaintance had begun would have been extremely trying. Now, by\nvirtue of a fortunate stand at the outset, he had spiked the\nmillionaire's guns.\n\nThirdly, and most important of all, he had not only made himself\nfamiliar with the locality and surroundings of the scarab, but he\nhad seen, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the removal of it\nand the earning of the five thousand dollars would be the\nsimplest possible task. Already he was spending the money in his",
        "mind. And to such lengths had optimism led him that, as he sat on\nhis bed reviewing the events of the day, his only doubt was\nwhether to get the scarab at once or to let it remain where it\nwas until he had the opportunity of doing Mr. Peters' interior\ngood on the lines he had mapped out in their conversation; for,\nof course, directly he had restored the scarab to its rightful\nowner and pocketed the reward, his position as healer and trainer\nto the millionaire would cease automatically.",
        "He was sorry for that, because it troubled him to think that a\nsick man would not be made well; but, on the whole, looking at it\nfrom every aspect, it would be best to get the scarab as soon as\npossible and leave Mr. Peters' digestion to look after itself.\nBeing twenty-six and an optimist, he had no suspicion that Fate\nmight be playing with him; that Fate might have unpleasant\nsurprises in store; that Fate even now was preparing to smite him",
        "in his hour of joy with that powerful weapon, the Efficient\nBaxter.\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was five minutes to one. He had no\nidea whether they kept early hours at Blandings Castle or not,\nbut he deemed it prudent to give the household another hour in\nwhich to settle down. After which he would just trot down and\ncollect the scarab.\n\nThe novel he had brought down with him from London fortunately\nproved interesting. Two o'clock came before he was ready for it.",
        "He slipped the book into his pocket and opened the door.\n\nAll was still--still and uncommonly dark. Along the corridor on\nwhich his room was situated the snores of sleeping domestics\nexploded, growled and twittered in the air. Every menial on the\nlist seemed to be snoring, some in one key, some in another, some\ndefiantly, some plaintively; but the main fact was that they were\nall snoring somehow, thus intimating that, so far as this side of",
        "the house was concerned, the coast might be considered clear and\ninterruption of his plans a negligible risk.\n\nResearches made at an earlier hour had familiarized him with the\ngeography of the place. He found his way to the green-baize door\nwithout difficulty and, stepping through, was in the hall, where\nthe remains of the log fire still glowed a fitful red. This,\nhowever, was the only illumination, and it was fortunate that he\ndid not require light to guide him to the museum.",
        "He knew the direction and had measured the distance. It was\nprecisely seventeen steps from where he stood. Cautiously, and\nwith avoidance of noise, he began to make the seventeen steps.\n\nHe was beginning the eleventh when he bumped into somebody--\nsomebody soft--somebody whose hand, as it touched his, felt small\nand feminine.\n\nThe fragment of a log fell on the ashes and the fire gave a dying\nspurt. Darkness succeeded the sudden glow. The fire was out.",
        "That little flame had been its last effort before expiring, but\nit had been enough to enable him to recognize Joan Valentine.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he gasped.\n\nHis astonishment was short-lived. Next moment the only thing that\nsurprised him was the fact that he was not more surprised. There\nwas something about this girl that made the most bizarre\nhappenings seem right and natural. Ever since he had met her his\nlife had changed from an orderly succession of uninteresting days",
        "to a strange carnival of the unexpected, and use was accustoming\nhim to it. Life had taken on the quality of a dream, in which\nanything might happen and in which everything that did happen was\nto be accepted with the calmness natural in dreams.\n\nIt was strange that she should be here in the pitch-dark hall in\nthe middle of the night; but--after all--no stranger than that he\nshould be. In this dream world in which he now moved it had to be",
        "taken for granted that people did all sorts of odd things from\nall sorts of odd motives.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed.\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"I think we are both here for the same reason.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say--\"\n\n\"Yes; I have come here to earn the five thousand dollars, too,\nMr. Marson. We are rivals.\"\n\nIn his present frame of mind it seemed so simple and intelligible\nto Ashe that he wondered whether he was really hearing it the\nfirst time. He had an odd feeling that he had known this all",
        "along.\n\n\"You are here to get the scarab?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nAshe was dimly conscious of some objection to this, but at first\nit eluded him. Then he pinned it down.\n\n\"But you aren't a young man of good appearance,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean. But Aline Peters is an old friend of\nmine. She told me her father would give a large reward to whoever\nrecovered the scarab; so I--\"\n\n\"Look out!\" whispered Ashe. \"Run! There's somebody coming!\"",
        "There was a soft footfall on the stairs, a click, and above\nAshe's head a light flashed out. He looked round. He was alone,\nand the green-baize door was swaying gently to and fro.\n\n\"Who's that? Who's there?\" said a voice.\n\nThe Efficient Baxter was coming down the broad staircase.\n\nA general suspicion of mankind and a definite and particular\nsuspicion of one individual made a bad opiate. For over an hour\nsleep had avoided the Efficient Baxter with an unconquerable",
        "coyness. He had tried all the known ways of wooing slumber, but\nthey had failed him, from the counting of sheep downward. The\nevents of the night had whipped his mind to a restless activity.\nTry as he might to lose consciousness, the recollection of the\nplot he had discovered surged up and kept him wakeful.\n\nIt is the penalty of the suspicious type of mind that it suffers\nfrom its own activity. From the moment he detected Mr. Peters in\nthe act of rifling the museum and marked down Ashe as an",
        "accomplice, Baxter's repose was doomed. Nor poppy nor mandragora,\nnor all the drowsy sirups of the world, could ever medicine him\nto that sweet sleep which he owed yesterday.\n\nBut it was the recollection that on previous occasions of\nwakefulness hot whisky and water had done the trick, which had\nnow brought him from his bed and downstairs. His objective was\nthe decanter on the table of the smoking-room, which was one of\nthe rooms opening on the gallery that looked down on the hall.",
        "Hot water he could achieve in his bedroom by means of his stove.\n\nSo out of bed he had climbed and downstairs he had come; and here\nhe was, to all appearances, just in time to foil the very plot on\nwhich he had been brooding. Mr. Peters might be in bed, but there\nin the hall below him stood the accomplice, not ten paces from\nthe museum's door. He arrived on the spot at racing speed and\nconfronted Ashe.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\nAnd then, from the Baxter viewpoint, things began to go wrong. By",
        "all the rules of the game, Ashe, caught, as it were, red-handed,\nshould have wilted, stammered and confessed all; but Ashe was\nfortified by that philosophic calm which comes to us in dreams,\nand, moreover, he had his story ready.\n\n\"Mr. Peters rang for me, sir.\"\n\nHe had never expected to feel grateful to the little firebrand\nwho employed him, but he had to admit that the millionaire, in\ntheir late conversation, had shown forethought. The thought",
        "struck him that but for Mr. Peters' advice he might by now be in\nan extremely awkward position; for his was not a swiftly\ninventive mind.\n\n\"Rang for you? At half-past two in the morning!\"\n\n\"To read to him, sir.\"\n\n\"To read to him at this hour?\"\n\n\"Mr. Peters suffers from insomnia, sir. He has a weak digestion\nand pain sometimes prevents him from sleeping. The lining of his\nstomach is not at all what it should be.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it.\"",
        "With that meekness which makes the good man wronged so impressive\na spectacle, Ashe produced and exhibited his novel.\n\n\"Here is the book I am about to read to him. I think, sir, if you\nwill excuse me, I had better be going to his room. Good night,\nsir.\"\n\nHe proceeded to mount the stairs. He was sorry for Mr. Peters, so\nshortly about to be roused from a refreshing slumber; but these\nwere life's tragedies and must be borne bravely.\n\nThe Efficient Baxter dogged him the whole way, sprinting silently",
        "in his wake and dodging into the shadows whenever the light of an\noccasional electric bulb made it inadvisable to keep to the open.\nThen abruptly he gave up the pursuit. For the first time his\ncomparative impotence in this silent conflict on which he had\nembarked was made manifest to him, and he perceived that on mere\nsuspicion, however strong, he could do nothing. To accuse Mr.\nPeters of theft or to accuse him of being accessory to a theft\nwas out of the question.",
        "Yet his whole being revolted at the thought of allowing the\nsanctity of the museum to be violated. Officially its contents\nbelonged to Lord Emsworth, but ever since his connection with the\ncastle he had been put in charge of them, and he had come to look\non them as his own property. If he was only a collector by proxy\nhe had, nevertheless, the collector's devotion to his curios,\nbeside which the lioness' attachment to her cubs is tepid; and he",
        "was prepared to do anything to retain in his possession a scarab\ntoward which he already entertained the feelings of a life\nproprietor.\n\nNo--not quite anything! He stopped short at the idea of causing\nunpleasantness between the father of the Honorable Freddie and\nthe father of the Honorable Freddie's fiancee. His secretarial\nposition at the castle was a valuable one and he was loath to\njeopardize it.\n\nThere was only one way in which this delicate affair could be",
        "brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It was obvious from what he\nhad seen that night that Mr. Peters' connection with the attempt\non the scarab was to be merely sympathetic, and that the actual\ntheft was to be accomplished by Ashe. His only course, therefore,\nwas to catch Ashe actually in the museum. Then Mr. Peters need\nnot appear in the matter at all. Mr. Peters' position in those\ncircumstances would be simply that of a man who had happened to",
        "employ, through no fault of his own, a valet who happened to be a\nthief.\n\nHe had made a mistake, he perceived, in locking the door of the\nmuseum. In future he must leave it open, as a trap is open;\nand he must stay up nights and keep watch. With these\nreflections, the Efficient Baxter returned to his room.\n\nMeantime Ashe had entered Mr. Peters' bedroom and switched on the\nlight. Mr. Peters, who had just succeeded in dropping off to\nsleep, sat up with a start.",
        "\"I've come to read to you,\" said Ashe.\n\nMr. Peters emitted a stifled howl, in which wrath and self-pity\nwere nicely blended.\n\n\"You fool, don't you know I have just managed to get to sleep?\"\n\n\"And now you're awake again,\" said Ashe soothingly. \"Such is\nlife! A little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep, and\nthen bing!--off we go again. I hope you will like this novel. I\ndipped into it and it seems good.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by coming in here at this time of night? Are\nyou crazy?\"",
        "\"It was your suggestion; and, by the way, I must thank you for\nit. I apologize for calling it thin. It worked like a charm.

Have you been after my--my Cheops?\"\n\n\"I have been after your Cheops, but I didn't get it. Bad men were\nabroad. That fellow with the spectacles, who was in the museum",
        "when I met you there this evening, swooped down from nowhere, and\nI had to tell him that you had rung for me to read to you.\nFortunately I had this novel on me. I think he followed me\nupstairs to see whether I really did come to your room.\"\n\nMr. Peters groaned miserably.\n\n\"Baxter,\" he said; \"He's a man named Baxter--Lord Emsworth's\nprivate secretary; and he suspects us. He's the man we--I mean\nyou--have got to look out for.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind. Let's be happy while we can. Make yourself",

        "\"Request your canine friend to withdraw,\" said Ashe. \"He prevents\nme from marshaling my thoughts.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he won't withdraw.\"\n\n\"Never mind. I'll do my best in spite of him. Tell me, was I\ndreaming or did I really meet you in the hall this morning at\nabout twenty minutes after two?\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"And did you really tell me that you had come to the castle to\nsteal--\"\n\n\"Recover.\"\n\n\"--Recover Mr. Peters' scarab?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Then it's true?\"\n\n\"It is.\"",

        "\"I like you, Mr. Marson; but we must not let sentiment interfere\nwith business. You want Mr. Peters' five thousand dollars.

Well,\ndon't you think I should feel a little mean if I thought you were\nnot trying your hardest to get it, simply because you didn't\nthink it would be fair to try your hardest against a woman?

        "\"No, no. The risks are practically nonexistent.\"\n\n\"I thought you said just now that it would be madness for either\nof us to attempt to go to the museum at present.\" Joan laughed.\n\"It won't do, Mr. Marson.

I would reject\nthe corpse with horror and turn him out, but back he would come\nwith his loathsome gift. I simply couldn't make him understand",
        "that he was not doing me a kindness. He thought highly of his\nmouse and it was beyond him to realize that I did not want it.\n\n\"You are just the same with your chivalry. It's very kind of you\nto keep offering me your dead mouse; but honestly I have no use\nfor it. I won't take favors just because I happen to be a female.\nIf we are going to form this partnership I insist on doing my\nfair share of the work and running my fair share of the\nrisks--the practically nonexistent risks.\"",

        "\"You don't do anything of the sort. We toss up for first chance,\nlike little ladies and gentlemen. Have you a coin?

        "It is worthy of record, in the light of after events, that at the\nbeginning of their visit it was the general opinion of the guests\ngathered together at Blandings Castle that the place was dull.\nThe house party had that air of torpor which one sees in the\nsaloon passengers of an Atlantic liner--that appearance of\nresignation to an enforced idleness and a monotony to be broken\nonly by meals. Lord Emsworth's guests gave the impression,\ncollectively, of being just about to yawn and look at their",
        "watches.\n\nThis was partly the fault of the time of year, for most house\nparties are dull if they happen to fall between the hunting and\nthe shooting seasons, but must be attributed chiefly to Lord\nEmsworth's extremely sketchy notions of the duties of a host.\n\nA host has no right to interne a regiment of his relations in his\nhouse unless he also invites lively and agreeable outsiders to\nmeet them. If he does commit this solecism the least he can do is",
        "to work himself to the bone in the effort to invent amusements\nand diversions for his victims. Lord Emsworth had failed badly in\nboth these matters. With the exception of Mr. Peters, his\ndaughter Aline and George Emerson, there was nobody in the house\nwho did not belong to the clan; and, as for his exerting himself\nto entertain, the company was lucky if it caught a glimpse of its\nhost at meals.\n\nLord Emsworth belonged to the people-who-like-to-be-left-alone-",
        "to-amuse-themselves-when-they-come-to-a-place school of hosts. He\npottered about the garden in an old coat--now uprooting a weed,\nnow wrangling with the autocrat from Scotland, who was\ntheoretically in his service as head gardener---dreamily\nsatisfied, when he thought of them at all, that his guests were\nas perfectly happy as he was.\n\nApart from his son Freddie, whom he had long since dismissed as a\nyouth of abnormal tastes, from whom nothing reasonable was to be",
        "expected, he could not imagine anyone not being content merely to\nbe at Blandings when the buds were bursting on the trees.\n\nA resolute hostess might have saved the situation; but Lady Ann\nWarblington's abilities in that direction stopped short at\nleaving everything to Mrs. Twemlow and writing letters in her\nbedroom. When Lady Ann Warblington was not writing letters in her\nbedroom--which was seldom, for she had an apparently\ninexhaustible correspondence--she was nursing sick headaches in",
        "it. She was one of those hostesses whom a guest never sees except\nwhen he goes into the library and espies the tail of her skirt\nvanishing through the other door.\n\nAs for the ordinary recreations of the country house, the guests\ncould frequent the billiard room, where they were sure to find\nLord Stockheath playing a hundred up with his cousin, Algernon\nWooster--a spectacle of the liveliest interest--or they could, if\nfond of golf, console themselves for the absence of links in the",
        "neighborhood with the exhilarating pastime of clock golf; or they\ncould stroll about the terraces with such of their relations as\nthey happened to be on speaking terms with at the moment, and\nabuse their host and the rest of their relations.\n\nThis was the favorite amusement; and after breakfast, on a\nmorning ten days after Joan and Ashe had formed their compact,\nthe terraces were full of perambulating couples. Here, Colonel\nHorace Mant, walking with the Bishop of Godalming, was soothing",
        "that dignitary by clothing in soldierly words thoughts that the\nlatter had not been able to crush down, but which his holy office\nscarcely permitted him to utter.\n\nThere, Lady Mildred Mant, linked to Mrs. Jack Hale, of the\ncollateral branch of the family, was saying things about her\nfather in his capacity of host and entertainer, that were making\nher companion feel like another woman. Farther on, stopping\noccasionally to gesticulate, could be seen other Emsworth",
        "relations and connections. It was a typical scene of quiet,\npeaceful English family life.\n\nLeaning on the broad stone balustrade of the upper terrace, Aline\nPeters and George Emerson surveyed the malcontents. Aline gave a\nlittle sigh, almost inaudible; but George's hearing was good.\n\n\"I was wondering when you are going to admit it,\" he said,\nshifting his position so that he faced her.\n\n\"Admit what?\"\n\n\"That you can't stand the prospect; that the idea of being stuck",
        "for life with this crowd, like a fly on fly paper, is too much\nfor you; that you are ready to break off your engagement to\nFreddie and come away and marry me and live happily ever after.\"\n\n\"George!\"\n\n\"Well, wasn't that what it meant? Be honest!\"\n\n\"What what meant?\"\n\n\"That sigh.\"\n\n\"I didn't sigh. I was just breathing.\"\n\n\"Then you can breathe in this atmosphere! You surprise me!\" He\nraked the terraces with hostile eyes. \"Look at them! Look at",
        "them--crawling round like doped beetles. My dear girl, it's no\nuse your pretending that this sort of thing wouldn't kill you.\nYou're pining away already. You're thinner and paler since you\ncame here. Gee! How we shall look back at this and thank our\nstars that we're out of it when we're back in old New York, with\nthe elevated rattling and the street cars squealing over the\npoints, and something doing every step you take. I shall call you",
        "on the 'phone from the office and have you meet me down town\nsomewhere, and we'll have a bite to eat and go to some show, and\na bit of supper afterward and a dance or two; and then go home to\nour cozy---\"\n\n\"George, you mustn't--really!\"\n\n\"Why mustn't I?\"\n\n\"It's wrong. You can't talk like that when we are both enjoying\nthe hospitality--\"\n\nA wild laugh, almost a howl, disturbed the talk of the most\nadjacent of the perambulating relations. Colonel Horace Mant,",
        "checked in mid-sentence, looked up resentfully at the cause of\nthe interruption.\n\n\"I wish somebody would tell me whether it's that American fellow,\nEmerson, or young Freddie who's supposed to be engaged to Miss\nPeters. Hanged if you ever see her and Freddie together, but she\nand Emerson are never to be found apart. If my respected\nfather-in-law had any sense I should have thought he would have\nhad sense enough to stop that.\"\n\n\"You forget, my dear Horace,\" said the bishop charitably; \"Miss",
        "Peters and Mr. Emerson have known each other since they were\nchildren.\"\n\n\"They were never nearly such children as Emsworth is now,\"\nsnorted the colonel. \"If that girl isn't in love with Emerson\nI'll be--I'll eat my hat.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the bishop. \"No, no! Surely not, Horace. What were\nyou saying when you broke off?\"\n\n\"I was saying that if a man wanted his relations never to speak\nto each other again for the rest of their lives the best thing he",
        "could do would be to herd them all together in a dashed barrack\nof a house a hundred miles from anywhere, and then go off and\nspend all his time prodding dashed flower beds with a spud--dash\nit!\"\n\n\"Just so; just so. So you were. Go on, Horace; I find a curious\ncomfort in your words.\"\n\nOn the terrace above them Aline was looking at George with\nstartled eyes.\n\n\"George!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry; but you shouldn't spring these jokes on me so\nsuddenly. You said enjoying! Yes--reveling in it, aren't we!\"",
        "\"It's a lovely old place,\" said Aline defensively.\n\n\"And when you've said that you've said everything. You can't live\non scenery and architecture for the rest of your life. There's\nthe human element to be thought of. And you're beginning--\"\n\n\"There goes father,\" interrupted Aline. \"How fast he is walking!\nGeorge, have you noticed a sort of difference in father these\nlast few days?\"\n\n\"I haven't. My specialty is keeping an eye on the rest of the\nPeters family.\"",
        "\"He seems better somehow. He seems to have almost stopped\nsmoking--and I'm very glad, for those cigars were awfully bad for\nhim.

My bedroom is next to his, you know, and every\nmorning I can hear things going on through the wall--father\ndancing about and puffing a good deal. And one morning I met his\nvalet going in with a pair of Indian clubs. I believe father is",
        "really taking himself in hand at last.\"\n\nGeorge Emerson exploded.\n\n\"And about time, too!

        "terrace, and that was one thing which exercised his mind, for he\nsuspected George Emerson. He suspected him nebulously as a snake\nin the grass; as an influence working against the orderly\nprogress of events concerning the marriage that had been arranged\nand would shortly take place between Miss Peters and the\nHonorable Frederick Threepwood.\n\nIt would be too much to say that he had any idea that George was\nputting in such hard and consistent work in his serpentine role;",
        "indeed if he could have overheard the conversation just recorded\nit is probable that Rupert Baxter would have had heart failure;\nbut he had observed the intimacy between the two as he observed\nmost things in his immediate neighborhood, and he disapproved of\nit. It was all very well to say that George Emerson had known\nAline Peters since she was a child. If that was so, then in the\nopinion of the Efficient Baxter he had known her quite long",
        "enough and ought to start making the acquaintance of somebody\nelse.\n\nHe blamed the Honorable Freddie. If the Honorable Freddie had\nbeen a more ardent lover he would have spent his time with Aline,\nand George Emerson would have taken his proper place as one of\nthe crowd at the back of the stage. But Freddie's view of the\nmatter seemed to be that he had done all that could be expected\nof a chappie in getting engaged to the girl, and that now he",
        "might consider himself at liberty to drop her for a while.\n\nSo Baxter, as he bicycled to Market Blandings for tobacco,\nbrooded on Freddie, Aline Peters and George Emerson. He also\nbrooded on Mr. Peters and Ashe Marson. Finally he brooded in a\ngeneral way, because he had had very little sleep the past week.\n\nThe spectacle of a young man doing his duty and enduring\nconsiderable discomforts while doing it is painful; but there is\nsuch uplift in it, it affords so excellent a moral picture, that",
        "I cannot omit a short description of the manner in which Rupert\nBaxter had spent the nights which had elapsed since his meeting\nwith Ashe in the small hours in the hall.\n\nIn the gallery which ran above the hall there was a large chair,\nsituated a few paces from the great staircase. On this, in an\novercoat--for the nights were chilly--and rubber-soled shoes, the\nEfficient Baxter had sat, without missing a single night, from\none in the morning until daybreak, waiting, waiting, waiting. It",
        "had been an ordeal to try the stoutest determination. Nature had\nnever intended Baxter for a night bird. He loved his bed. He knew\nthat doctors held that insufficient sleep made a man pale and\nsallow, and he had always aimed at the peach-bloom complexion\nwhich comes from a sensible eight hours between the sheets.\n\nOne of the King Georges of England--I forget which--once said\nthat a certain number of hours' sleep each night--I cannot recall",
        "at the moment how many--made a man something, which for the time\nbeing has slipped my memory. Baxter agreed with him. It went\nagainst all his instincts to sit up in this fashion; but it was\nhis duty and he did it.\n\nIt troubled him that, as night after night went by and Ashe, the\nsuspect, did not walk into the trap so carefully laid for him, he\nfound an increasing difficulty in keeping awake. The first two or\nthree of his series of vigils he had passed in an unimpeachable",
        "wakefulness, his chin resting on the rail of the gallery and his\nears alert for the slightest sound; but he had not been able to\nmaintain this standard of excellence.\n\nOn several occasions he had caught himself in the act of dropping\noff, and the last night he had actually wakened with a start to\nfind it quite light. As his last recollection before that was of\nan inky darkness impenetrable to the eye, dismay gripped him with\na sudden clutch and he ran swiftly down to the museum. His",
        "relief on finding that the scarab was still there had been\ntempered by thoughts of what might have been.\n\nBaxter, then, as he bicycled to Market Blandings for tobacco, had\ngood reason to brood. Having bought his tobacco and observed the\nlife and thought of the town for half an hour--it was market day\nand the normal stagnation of the place was temporarily relieved\nand brightened by pigs that eluded their keepers, and a bull calf\nwhich caught a stout farmer at the psychological moment when he",
        "was tying his shoe lace and lifted him six feet--he made his way\nto the Emsworth Arms, the most respectable of the eleven inns the\ncitizens of Market Blandings contrived in some miraculous way to\nsupport.\n\nIn English country towns, if the public houses do not actually\noutnumber the inhabitants, they all do an excellent trade. It is\nonly when they are two to one that hard times hit them and set\nthe innkeepers to blaming the government.",
        "It was not the busy bar, full to overflowing with honest British\nyeomen--many of them in a similar condition--that Baxter sought.\nHis goal was the genteel dining-room on the first floor, where a\nbald and shuffling waiter, own cousin to a tortoise, served\nluncheon to those desiring it. Lack of sleep had reduced Baxter\nto a condition where the presence and chatter of the house party\nwere insupportable. It was his purpose to lunch at the Emsworth\nArms and take a nap in an armchair afterward.",
        "He had relied on having the room to himself, for Market Blandings\ndid not lunch to a great extent; but to his annoyance and\ndisappointment the room was already occupied by a man in brown\ntweeds.\n\nOccupied is the correct word, for at first sight this man seemed\nto fill the room. Never since almost forgotten days when he used\nto frequent circuses and side shows, had Baxter seen a fellow\nhuman being so extraordinarily obese. He was a man about fifty",
        "years old, gray-haired, of a mauve complexion, and his general\nappearance suggested joviality.\n\nTo Baxter's chagrin, this person engaged him in conversation\ndirectly he took his seat at the table. There was only one table\nin the room, as is customary in English inns, and it had the\ndisadvantage that it collected those seated at it into one party.\nIt was impossible for Baxter to withdraw into himself and ignore\nthis person's advances.",
        "It is doubtful whether he could have done it, however, had they\nbeen separated by yards of floor, for the fat man was not only\nnaturally talkative but, as appeared from his opening remarks,\nspeech had been dammed up within him for some time by lack of a\nsuitable victim.\n\n\"Morning!\" he began; \"nice day. Good for the farmers. I'll move\nup to your end of the table if I may, sir. Waiter, bring my beef\nto this gentleman's end of the table.\"\n\nHe creaked into a chair at Baxter's side and resumed:",
        "\"Infernally quiet place, this, sir. I haven't found a soul to\nspeak to since I arrived yesterday afternoon except deaf-and-dumb\nrustics. Are you making a long stay here?\"\n\n\"I live outside the town.\"\n\n\"I pity you. Wouldn't care to do it myself. Had to come here on\nbusiness and shan't be sorry when it's finished. I give you my\nword I couldn't sleep a wink last night because of the quiet. I\nwas just dropping off when a beast of a bird outside the window",

I'm so reduced that I'll go and see the",
        "Methodist Chapel, if there is one.\"\n\nFresh air, want of sleep and the closeness of the dining-room\ncombined to make Baxter drowsy. He ate his lunch in a torpor,\nhardly replying to his companion's remarks, who, for his part,\ndid not seem to wish or to expect replies. It was enough for him\nto be talking.\n\n\"What do people do with themselves in a place like this? When\nthey want amusement, I mean. I suppose it's different if you've\nbeen brought up to it.

What should I say, 'Hello, Freddie!' for?\"\n\nThe conundrum was unanswerable. Baxter did not attempt to answer\nit. But there remained at the back of his mind a quaint idea that\nhe had caught sight, as he woke, of the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood, his face warningly contorted, vanishing through the\ndoorway. Yet what could the Honorable Freddie be doing at the\nEmsworth Arms?",
        "A solution of the difficulty occurred to him: he had dreamed he\nhad seen Freddie and that had suggested the words which, reason\npointed out, his companion could hardly have spoken. Even if the\nHonorable Freddie should enter the room, this fat man, who was\napparently a drummer of some kind, would certainly not know who\nhe was, nor would he address him so familiarly.\n\nYes, that must be the explanation. After all, the quaintest\nthings happened in dreams. Last night, when he had fallen asleep",

He wondered whether\nBaxter had recognized him. He wondered whether Baxter had heard\nR. Jones say, \"Hello, Freddie!\"\n\nHe wondered, if such should be the case, whether R.

After the\nfirst passionate burst of resistance he had settled down into a\nmodel pupil in Ashe's one-man school of physical culture. It had",

His aspect was the aspect of one\nwaiting for the appointed hour. Smoking his second cigarette, he\nresumed his meditations. They had to do with Aline Peters.\n\nGeorge Emerson was troubled about Aline Peters. Watching over\nher, as he did, with a lover's eye, he had perceived that about\nher which distressed him. On the terrace that morning she had",
        "been abrupt to him--what in a girl of less angelic disposition\none might have called snappy. Yes, to be just, she had snapped at\nhim. That meant something. It meant that Aline was not well. It\nmeant what her pallor and tired eyes meant--that the life she was\nleading was doing her no good.\n\nEleven nights had George dined at Blandings Castle, and on each\nof the eleven nights he had been distressed to see the manner in\nwhich Aline, declining the baked meats, had restricted herself to",
        "the miserable vegetable messes which were all that doctor's\norders permitted to her suffering father. George's pity had its\nlimits. His heart did not bleed for Mr. Peters. Mr. Peters' diet\nwas his own affair. But that Aline should starve herself in this\nfashion, purely by way of moral support for her parent, was\nanother matter.\n\nGeorge was perhaps a shade material. Himself a robust young man\nand taking what might be called an outsize in meals, he attached",
        "perhaps too much importance to food as an adjunct to the perfect\nlife. In his survey of Aline he took a line through his own\nrequirements; and believing that eleven such dinners as he had\nseen Aline partake of would have killed him he decided that his\nloved one was on the point of starvation.\n\nNo human being, he held, could exist on such Barmecide feasts.\nThat Mr. Peters continued to do so did not occur to him as a flaw\nin his reasoning. He looked on Mr. Peters as a sort of machine.",
        "Successful business men often give that impression to the young.\nIf George had been told that Mr. Peters went along on gasoline,\nlike an automobile, he would not have been much surprised. But\nthat Aline--his Aline--should have to deny herself the exercise\nof that mastication of rich meats which, together with the gift\nof speech, raises man above the beasts of the field---- That was\nwhat tortured George.\n\nHe had devoted the day to thinking out a solution of the problem.",
        "Such was the overflowing goodness of Aline's heart that not even\nhe could persuade her to withdraw her moral support from her\nfather and devote herself to keeping up her strength as she\nshould do. It was necessary to think of some other plan.\n\nAnd then a speech of hers had come back to him. She had\nsaid--poor child:\n\n\"I do get a little hungry sometimes--late at night generally.\"\n\nThe problem was solved. Food should be brought to her late at\nnight.",
        "On the table by his bed was a stout sheet of packing paper. On\nthis lay, like one of those pictures in still life that one sees\non suburban parlor walls, a tongue, some bread, a knife, a fork,\nsalt, a corkscrew and a small bottle of white wine.\n\nIt is a pleasure, when one has been able hitherto to portray\nGeorge's devotion only through the medium of his speeches, to\nproduce these comestibles as Exhibit A, to show that he loved\nAline with no common love; for it had not been an easy task to",
        "get them there. In a house of smaller dimensions he would have\nraided the larder without shame, but at Blandings Castle there\nwas no saying where the larder might be. All he knew was that it\nlay somewhere beyond that green-baize door opening on the hall,\npast which he was wont to go on his way to bed. To prowl through\nthe maze of the servants' quarters in search of it was\nimpossible. The only thing to be done was to go to Market\nBlandings and buy the things.",
        "Fortune had helped him at the start by arranging that the\nHonorable Freddie, also, should be going to Market Blandings in\nthe little runabout, which seated two. He had acquiesced in\nGeorge's suggestion that he, George, should occupy the other\nseat, but with a certain lack of enthusiasm it seemed to George.\nHe had not volunteered any reason as to why he was going to\nMarket Blandings in the little runabout, and on arrival there had\nbetrayed an unmistakable desire to get rid of George at the",
        "earliest opportunity.\n\nAs this had suited George to perfection, he being desirous of\ngetting rid of the Honorable Freddie at the earliest opportunity,\nhe had not been inquisitive, and they had parted on the outskirts\nof the town without mutual confidences.\n\nGeorge had then proceeded to the grocer's, and after that to\nanother of the Market Blandings inns, not the Emsworth Arms,\nwhere he had bought the white wine. He did not believe in the\nlocal white wine, for he was a young man with a palate and",
        "mistrusted country cellars, but he assumed that, whatever its\nquality, it would cheer Aline in the small hours.\n\nHe had then tramped the whole five miles back to the castle with\nhis purchases. It was here that his real troubles began and the\nquality of his love was tested. The walk, to a heavily laden man,\nwas bad enough; but it was as nothing compared with the ordeal of\nsmuggling the cargo up to his bedroom. Superhuman though he was,\nGeorge was alive to the delicacy of the situation. One cannot",
        "convey food and drink to one's room in a strange house without,\nif detected, seeming to cast a slur on the table of the host. It\nwas as one who carries dispatches through an enemy's lines that\nGeorge took cover, emerged from cover, dodged, ducked and ran;\nand the moment when he sank down on his bed, the door locked\nbehind him, was one of the happiest of his life.\n\nThe recollection of that ordeal made the one he proposed to\nembark on now seem slight in comparison. All he had to do was to",
        "go to Aline's room on the other side of the house, knock softly\non the door until signs of wakefulness made themselves heard from\nwithin, and then dart away into the shadows whence he had come,\nand so back to bed. He gave Aline credit for the intelligence\nthat would enable her, on finding a tongue, some bread, a knife,\na fork, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine on the mat,\nto know what to do with them--and perhaps to guess whose was the\nloving hand that had laid them there.",
        "The second clause, however, was not important, for he proposed to\ntell her whose was the hand next morning. Other people might hide\ntheir light under a bushel--not George Emerson.\n\nIt only remained now to allow time to pass until the hour should\nbe sufficiently advanced to insure safety for the expedition. He\nlooked at his watch again. It was nearly two. By this time the\nhouse must be asleep.\n\nHe gathered up the tongue, the bread, the knife, the fork, the",

        "later but this same man!\n\nIt happened in a somewhat singular manner, though it all seemed\nperfectly logical and consecutive to Baxter. He was climbing up\nthe outer wall of Westminster Abbey in his pyjamas and a tall\nhat, when the fat man, suddenly thrusting his head out of a\nwindow which Baxter had not noticed until that moment, said,\n\"Hello, Freddie!\"\n\nBaxter was about to explain that his name was not Freddie when he\nfound himself walking down Piccadilly with Ashe Marson. Ashe said",
        "to him: \"Nobody loves me. Everybody steals my grapefruit!\" And\nthe pathos of it cut the Efficient Baxter like a knife. He was on\nthe point of replying; when Ashe vanished and Baxter discovered\nthat he was not in Piccadilly, as he had supposed, but in an\naeroplane with Mr. Peters, hovering over the castle.\n\nMr. Peters had a bomb in his hand, which he was fondling with\nloving care. He explained to Baxter that he had stolen it from\nthe Earl of Emsworth's museum. \"I did it with a slice of cold",
        "beef and a pickle,\" he explained; and Baxter found himself\nrealizing that that was the only way. \"Now watch me drop it,\"\nsaid Mr. Peters, closing one eye and taking aim at the castle.\n\"I have to do this by the doctor's orders.\"\n\nHe loosed the bomb and immediately Baxter was lying in bed\nwatching it drop. He was frightened, but the idea of moving did\nnot occur to him. The bomb fell very slowly, dipping and\nfluttering like a feather. It came closer and closer. Then it",
        "struck with a roar and a sheet of flame.\n\nBaxter woke to a sound of tumult and crashing. For a moment he\nhovered between dreaming and waking, and then sleep passed from\nhim, and he was aware that something noisy and exciting was in\nprogress in the hall below.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nComing down to first causes, the only reason why collisions of\nany kind occur is because two bodies defy Nature's law that a\ngiven spot on a given plane shall at a given moment of time be",
        "occupied by only one body.\n\nThere was a certain spot near the foot of the great staircase\nwhich Ashe, coming downstairs from Mr. Peters' room, and George\nEmerson, coming up to Aline's room, had to pass on their\nrespective routes. George reached it at one minute and three\nseconds after two a.m., moving silently but swiftly; and Ashe,\nalso maintaining a good rate of speed, arrived there at one\nminute and four seconds after the hour, when he ceased to walk",
        "and began to fly, accompanied by George Emerson, now going down.\nHis arms were round George's neck and George was clinging to his\nwaist.\n\nIn due season they reached the foot of the stairs and a small\ntable, covered with occasional china and photographs in frames,\nwhich lay adjacent to the foot of the stairs. That--especially\nthe occasional china--was what Baxter had heard.\n\nGeorge Emerson thought it was a burglar. Ashe did not know what",
        "it was, but he knew he wanted to shake it off; so he insinuated a\nhand beneath George's chin and pushed upward. George, by this\ntime parted forever from the tongue, the bread, the knife, the\nfork, the salt, the corkscrew and the bottle of white wine, and\nhaving both hands free for the work of the moment, held Ashe with\nthe left and punched him in the ribs with the right.\n\nAshe, removing his left arm from George's neck, brought it up as\na reinforcement to his right, and used both as a means of",
        "throttling George. This led George, now permanently underneath,\nto grasp Ashe's ears firmly and twist them, relieving the\npressure on his throat and causing Ashe to utter the first vocal\nsound of the evening, other than the explosive Ugh! that both had\nemitted at the instant of impact.\n\nAshe dislodged George's hands from his ears and hit George in the\nribs with his elbow. George kicked Ashe on the left ankle. Ashe\nrediscovered George's throat and began to squeeze it afresh; and",
        "a pleasant time was being had by all when the Efficient Baxter,\nwhizzing down the stairs, tripped over Ashe's legs, shot forward\nand cannoned into another table, also covered with occasional\nchina and photographs in frames.\n\nThe hall at Blandings Castle was more an extra drawing-room than\na hall; and, when not nursing a sick headache in her bedroom,\nLady Ann Warblington would dispense afternoon tea there to her\nguests. Consequently it was dotted pretty freely with small",
        "tables. There were, indeed, no fewer than five more in various\nspots, waiting to be bumped into and smashed.\n\nThe bumping into and smashing of small tables, however, is a task\nthat calls for plenty of time, a leisured pursuit; and neither\nGeorge nor Ashe, a third party having been added to their little\naffair, felt a desire to stay on and do the thing properly. Ashe\nwas strongly opposed to being discovered and called on to account\nfor his presence there at that hour; and George, conscious of the",
        "tongue and its adjuncts now strewn about the hall, had a similar\nprejudice against the tedious explanations that detection must\ninvolve.\n\nAs though by mutual consent each relaxed his grip. They stood\npanting for an instant; then, Ashe in the direction where he\nsupposed the green-baize door of the servants' quarters to be,\nGeorge to the staircase that led to his bedroom, they went away\nfrom that place.\n\nThey had hardly done so when Baxter, having disassociated himself",
        "from the contents of the table he had upset, began to grope his\nway toward the electric-light switch, the same being situated\nnear the foot of the main staircase. He went on all fours, as a\nsafer method of locomotion, though slower, than the one he had\nattempted before.\n\nNoises began to make themselves heard on the floors above. Roused\nby the merry crackle of occasional china, the house party was\nbestirring itself to investigate. Voices sounded, muffled and\ninquiring.",
        "Meantime Baxter crawled steadily on his hands and knees toward\nthe light switch. He was in much the same condition as one White\nHope of the ring is after he has put his chin in the way of the\nfist of a rival member of the Truck Drivers' Union. He knew that\nhe was still alive. More he could not say. The mists of sleep,\nwhich still shrouded his brain, and the shake-up he had had from\nhis encounter with the table, a corner of which he had rammed",
        "with the top of his head, combined to produce a dreamlike state.\n\nAnd so the Efficient Baxter crawled on; and as he crawled his\nhand, advancing cautiously, fell on something--something that was\nnot alive; something clammy and ice-cold, the touch of which\nfilled him with a nameless horror.\n\nTo say that Baxter's heart stood still would be physiologically\ninexact. The heart does not stand still. Whatever the emotions of\nits owner, it goes on beating. It would be more accurate to say",
        "that Baxter felt like a man taking his first ride in an express\nelevator, who has outstripped his vital organs by several floors\nand sees no immediate prospect of their ever catching up with him\nagain. There was a great cold void where the more intimate parts\nof his body should have been. His throat was dry and contracted.\nThe flesh of his back crawled, for he knew what it was he had\ntouched.\n\nPainful and absorbing as had been his encounter with the table,",
        "Baxter had never lost sight of the fact that close beside him a\nfurious battle between unseen forces was in progress. He had\nheard the bumping and the thumping and the tense breathing even\nas he picked occasional china from his person. Such a combat, he\nhad felt, could hardly fail to result in personal injury to\neither the party of the first part or the party of the second\npart, or both. He knew now that worse than mere injury had\nhappened, and that he knelt in the presence of death.",
        "There was no doubt that the man was dead. Insensibility alone\ncould never have produced this icy chill. He raised his head in\nthe darkness, and cried aloud to those approaching. He meant to\ncry: \"Help! Murder!\" But fear prevented clear articulation. What\nhe shouted was: \"Heh! Mer!\" On which, from the neighborhood of\nthe staircase, somebody began to fire a revolver.\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth had been sleeping a sound and peaceful sleep\nwhen the imbroglio began downstairs. He sat up and listened. Yes;",
        "undoubtedly burglars! He switched on his light and jumped out of\nbed. He took a pistol from a drawer, and thus armed went to look\ninto the matter. The dreamy peer was no poltroon.\n\nIt was quite dark when he arrived on the scene of conflict, in\nthe van of a mixed bevy of pyjamaed and dressing-gowned\nrelations. He was in the van because, meeting these relations in\nthe passage above, he had said to them: \"Let me go first. I have\na pistol.\" And they had let him go first. They were, indeed,",
        "awfully nice about it, not thrusting themselves forward or\njostling or anything, but behaving in a modest and self-effacing\nmanner that was pretty to watch.\n\nWhen Lord Emsworth said, \"Let me go first,\" young Algernon\nWooster, who was on the very point of leaping to the fore, said,\n\"Yes, by Jove! Sound scheme, by Gad!\"--and withdrew into the\nbackground; and the Bishop of Godalming said: \"By all means,\nClarence undoubtedly; most certainly precede us.\"",
        "When his sense of touch told him he had reached the foot of the\nstairs, Lord Emsworth paused. The hall was very dark and the\nburglars seemed temporarily to have suspended activities. And\nthen one of them, a man with a ruffianly, grating voice, spoke.\nWhat it was he said Lord Emsworth could not understand. It\nsounded like \"Heh! Mer!\"--probably some secret signal to his\nconfederates. Lord Emsworth raised his revolver and emptied it in\nthe direction of the sound.",
        "Extremely fortunately for him, the Efficient Baxter had not\nchanged his all-fours attitude. This undoubtedly saved Lord\nEmsworth the worry of engaging a new secretary. The shots sang\nabove Baxter's head one after the other, six in all, and found\nother billets than his person. They disposed themselves as\nfollows: The first shot broke a window and whistled out into the\nnight; the second shot hit the dinner gong and made a perfectly\nextraordinary noise, like the Last Trump; the third, fourth and",
        "fifth shots embedded themselves in the wall; the sixth and final\nshot hit a life-size picture of his lordship's grandmother in the\nface and improved it out of all knowledge.\n\nOne thinks no worse of Lord Emsworth's grandmother because she\nlooked like Eddie Foy, and had allowed herself to be painted,\nafter the heavy classic manner of some of the portraits of a\nhundred years ago, in the character of Venus--suitably draped, of\ncourse, rising from the sea; but it was beyond the possibility of",
        "denial that her grandson's bullet permanently removed one of\nBlandings Castle's most prominent eyesores.\n\nHaving emptied his revolver, Lord Emsworth said, \"Who is there?\nSpeak!\" in rather an aggrieved tone, as though he felt he had\ndone his part in breaking the ice, and it was now for the\nintruder to exert himself and bear his share of the social\namenities.\n\nThe Efficient Baxter did not reply. Nothing in the world could\nhave induced him to speak at that moment, or to make any sound",
        "whatsoever that might betray his position to a dangerous maniac\nwho might at any instant reload his pistol and resume the\nfusillade. Explanations, in his opinion, could be deferred until\nsomebody had the presence of mind to switch on the lights. He\nflattened himself on the carpet and hoped for better things. His\ncheek touched the corpse beside him; but though he winced and\nshuddered he made no outcry. After those six shots he was through\nwith outcries.",
        "A voice from above, the bishop's voice, said: \"I think you have\nkilled him, Clarence.\"\n\nAnother voice, that of Colonel Horace Mant, said: \"Switch on\nthose dashed lights! Why doesn't somebody? Dash it!\"\n\nThe whole strength of the company began to demand light.\n\nWhen the lights came, it was from the other side of the hall.\nSix revolver shots, fired at quarter past two in the morning,\nwill rouse even sleeping domestics. The servants' quarters were",
        "buzzing like a hive. Shrill feminine screams were puncturing the\nair. Mr. Beach, the butler, in a suit of pink silk pajamas, of\nwhich no one would have suspected him, was leading a party of men\nservants down the stairs--not so much because he wanted to lead\nthem as because they pushed him.\n\nThe passage beyond the green-baize door became congested, and\nthere were cries for Mr. Beach to open it and look through and\nsee what was the matter; but Mr. Beach was smarter than that and",
        "wriggled back so that he no longer headed the procession. This\ndone, he shouted:\n\n\"Open that door there! Open that door! Look and see what the\nmatter is.\"\n\nAshe opened the door. Since his escape from the hall he had been\nlurking in the neighborhood of the green-baize door and had been\nengulfed by the swirling throng. Finding himself with elbowroom\nfor the first time, he pushed through, swung the door open and\nswitched on the lights.",
        "They shone on a collection of semi-dressed figures, crowding the\nstaircase; on a hall littered with china and glass; on a dented\ndinner gong; on an edited and improved portrait of the late\nCountess of Emsworth; and on the Efficient Baxter, in an overcoat\nand rubber-soled shoes, lying beside a cold tongue. At no great\ndistance lay a number of other objects--a knife, a fork, some\nbread, salt, a corkscrew and a bottle of white wine.\n\nUsing the word in the sense of saying something coherent, the",
        "Earl of Emsworth was the first to speak. He peered down at his\nrecumbent secretary and said:\n\n\"Baxter! My dear fellow--what the devil?\"\n\nThe feeling of the company was one of profound disappointment.\nThey were disgusted at the anticlimax. For an instant, when the\nEfficient one did not move, a hope began to stir; but as soon as\nit was seen that he was not even injured, gloom reigned. One of\ntwo things would have satisfied them--either a burglar or a",
        "corpse. A burglar would have been welcome, dead or alive; but, if\nBaxter proposed to fill the part adequately it was imperative\nthat he be dead. He had disappointed them deeply by turning out\nto be the object of their quest. That he should not have been\neven grazed was too much.\n\nThere was a cold silence as he slowly raised himself from the\nfloor. As his eyes fell on the tongue, he started and remained\ngazing fixedly at it. Surprise paralyzed him.",
        "Lord Emsworth was also looking at the tongue and he leaped to a\nnot unreasonable conclusion. He spoke coldly and haughtily; for\nhe was not only annoyed, like the others, at the anticlimax, but\noffended. He knew that he was not one of your energetic hosts who\nexert themselves unceasingly to supply their guests with\nentertainment; but there was one thing on which, as a host, he\ndid pride himself--in the material matters of life he did his\nguests well; he kept an admirable table.",
        "\"My dear Baxter,\" he said in the tones he usually reserved for\nthe correction of his son Freddie, \"if your hunger is so great\nthat you are unable to wait for breakfast and have to raid my\nlarder in the middle of the night, I wish to goodness you would\ncontrive to make less noise about it. I do not grudge you the\nfood--help yourself when you please--but do remember that people\nwho have not such keen appetites as yourself like to sleep during",
        "the night. A far better plan, my dear fellow, would be to have\nsandwiches or buns--or whatever you consider most sustaining--\nsent up to your bedroom.\"\n\nNot even the bullets had disordered Baxter's faculties so much as\nthis monstrous accusation. Explanations pushed and jostled one\nanother in his fermenting brain, but he could not utter them. On\nevery side he met gravely reproachful eyes. George Emerson was\nlooking at him in pained disgust. Ashe Marson's face was the face",
        "of one who could never have believed this had he not seen it with\nhis own eyes. The scrutiny of the knife-and-shoe boy was\nunendurable.\n\nHe stammered. Words began to proceed from him, tripping and\nstumbling over each other. Lord Emsworth's frigid disapproval did\nnot relax.\n\n\"Pray do not apologize, Baxter. The desire for food is human. It\nis your boisterous mode of securing and conveying it that I\ndeprecate. Let us all go to bed.\"\n\n\"But, Lord Emsworth-----\"",
        "\"To bed!\" repeated his lordship firmly.\n\nThe company began to stream moodily upstairs. The lights were\nswitched off. The Efficient Baxter dragged himself away. From the\ndarkness in the direction of the servants' door a voice spoke.\n\n\"Greedy pig!\" said the voice scornfully.\n\nIt sounded like the fresh young voice of the knife-and-shoe boy,\nbut Baxter was too broken to investigate. He continued his\nretreat without pausing.\n\n\"Stuffin' of 'isself at all hours!\" said the voice.",
        "There was a murmur of approval from the unseen throng of\ndomestics.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAs we grow older and realize more clearly the limitations of\nhuman happiness, we come to see that the only real and abiding\npleasure in life is to give pleasure to other people. One must\nassume that the Efficient Baxter had not reached the age when\nthis comes home to a man, for the fact that he had given genuine\npleasure to some dozens of his fellow-men brought him no balm.",
        "There was no doubt about the pleasure he had given. Once they had\ngot over their disappointment at finding that he was not a dead\nburglar, the house party rejoiced whole-heartedly at the break in\nthe monotony of life at Blandings Castle. Relations who had not\nbeen on speaking terms for years forgot their quarrels and\nstrolled about the grounds in perfect harmony, abusing Baxter.\nThe general verdict was that he was insane.\n\n\"Don't tell me that young fellow's all there,\" said Colonel",
        "Horace Mant; \"because I know better. Have you noticed his eye?\nFurtive! Shifty! Nasty gleam in it. Besides--dash it!--did you\nhappen to take a look at the hall last night after he had been\nthere? It was in ruins, my dear sir--absolute dashed ruins. It\nwas positively littered with broken china and tables that had\nbeen bowled over. Don't tell me that was just an accidental\ncollision in the dark.\n\n\"My dear sir, the man must have been thrashing about--absolutely",
        "thrashing about, like a dashed salmon on a dashed hook. He must\nhave had a paroxysm of some kind--some kind of a dashed fit. A\ndoctor could give you the name for it. It's a well-known form of\ninsanity. Paranoia--isn't that what they call it? Rush of blood\nto the head, followed by a general running amuck.\n\n\"I've heard fellows who have been in India talk of it. Natives\nget it. Don't know what they're doing, and charge through the\nstreets taking cracks at people with dashed whacking great",
        "knives. Same with this young man, probably in a modified form at\npresent. He ought to be in a home. One of these nights, if this\ngrows on him, he will be massacring Emsworth in his bed.\"\n\n\"My dear Horace!\" The Bishop of Godalming's voice was properly\nhorror-stricken; but there was a certain unctuous relish in it.\n\n\"Take my word for it! Though, mind you, I don't say they aren't\nwell suited. Everyone knows that Emsworth has been, to all",
        "practical intents and purposes, a dashed lunatic for years. What\nwas it that young fellow Emerson, Freddie's American friend, was\nsaying, the other day about some acquaintance of his who is not\nquite right in the head? Nobody in the house--is that it?\nSomething to that effect, at any rate. I felt at the time it was\na perfect description of Emsworth.\"\n\n\"My dear Horace! Your father-in-law! The head of the family!\"\n\n\"A dashed lunatic, my dear sir--head of the family or no head of",
        "the family. A man as absent-minded as he is has no right to call\nhimself sane. Nobody in the house--I recollect it now--nobody in\nthe house except gas, and that has not been turned on. That's\nEmsworth!\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter, who had just left his presence, was feeling\nmuch the same about his noble employer. After a sleepless night\nhe had begun at an early hour to try and corner Lord Emsworth in\norder to explain to him the true inwardness of last night's",
        "happenings. Eventually he had tracked him to the museum, where he\nfound him happily engaged in painting a cabinet of birds' eggs.\nHe was seated on a small stool, a large pot of red paint on the\nfloor beside him, dabbing at the cabinet with a dripping brush.\nHe was absorbed and made no attempt whatever to follow his\nsecretary's remarks.\n\nFor ten minutes Baxter gave a vivid picture of his vigil and the\nmanner in which it had been interrupted.",
        "\"Just so; just so, my dear fellow,\" said the earl when he had\nfinished. \"I quite understand. All I say is, if you do require\nadditional food in the night let one of the servants bring it to\nyour room before bedtime; then there will be no danger of these\ndisturbances. There is no possible objection to your eating a\nhundred meals a day, my good Baxter, provided you do not rouse\nthe whole house over them. Some of us like to sleep during the\nnight.\"",
        "\"But, Lord Emsworth! I have just explained--It was not--I was\nnot--\"\n\n\"Never mind, my dear fellow; never mind. Why make such an\nimportant thing of it? Many people like a light snack before\nactually retiring. Doctors, I believe, sometimes recommend it.\nTell me, Baxter, how do you think the museum looks now? A little\nbrighter? Better for the dash of color? I think so. Museums are\ngenerally such gloomy places.\"\n\n\"Lord Emsworth, may I explain once again?\"\n\nThe earl looked annoyed.",
        "\"My dear Baxter, I have told you that there is nothing to\nexplain. You are getting a little tedious. What a deep, rich red\nthis is, and how clean new paint smells! Do you know, Baxter, I\nhave been longing to mess about with paint ever since I was a\nboy! I recollect my old father beating me with a walking stick.\n. . . That would be before your time, of course. By the way, if\nyou see Freddie, will you tell him I want to speak to him? He\nprobably is in the smoking-room. Send him to me here.\"",
        "It was an overwrought Baxter who delivered the message to the\nHonorable Freddie, who, as predicted, was in the smoking-room,\nlounging in a deep armchair.\n\nThere are times when life presses hard on a man, and it pressed\nhard on Baxter now. Fate had played him a sorry trick. It had put\nhim in a position where he had to choose between two courses,\neach as disagreeable as the other. He must either face a possible\nsecond fiasco like that of last night, or else he must abandon",
        "his post and cease to mount guard over his threatened treasure.\n\nHis imagination quailed at the thought of a repetition of last\nnight's horrors. He had been badly shaken by his collision with\nthe table and even more so by the events that had followed it.\nThose revolver shots still rang in his ears.\n\nIt was probably the memory of those shots that turned the scale.\nIt was unlikely he would again become entangled with a man\nbearing a tongue and the other things--he had given up in despair",
        "the attempt to unravel the mystery of the tongue; it completely\nbaffled him--but it was by no means unlikely that if he spent\nanother night in the gallery looking on the hall he might not\nagain become a target for Lord Emsworth's irresponsible firearm.\nNothing, in fact, was more likely; for in the disturbed state of\nthe public mind the slightest sound after nightfall would be\nsufficient cause for a fusillade.\n\nHe had actually overheard young Algernon Wooster telling Lord",
        "Stockheath he had a jolly good mind to sit on the stairs that\nnight with a shotgun, because it was his opinion that there was a\njolly sight more in this business than there seemed to be; and\nwhat he thought of the bally affair was that there was a gang of\nsome kind at work, and that that feller--what's-his-name?--that\nfeller Baxter was some sort of an accomplice.\n\nWith these things in his mind Baxter decided to remain that night\nin the security of his bedroom. He had lost his nerve. He formed",
        "this decision with the utmost reluctance, for the thought of\nleaving the road to the museum clear for marauders was bitter in\nthe extreme. If he could have overheard a conversation between\nJoan Valentine and Ashe Marson it is probable he would have\nrisked Lord Emsworth's revolver and the shotgun of the Honorable\nAlgernon Wooster.\n\nAshe, when he met Joan and recounted the events of the night, at\nwhich Joan, who was a sound sleeper, had not been present, was",
        "inclined to blame himself as a failure. True, fate had been\nagainst him, but the fact remained that he had achieved nothing.\nJoan, however, was not of this opinion.\n\n\"You have done wonders,\" she said. \"You have cleared the way for\nme. That is my idea of real teamwork. I'm so glad now that we\nformed our partnership. It would have been too bad if I had got\nall the advantage of your work and had jumped in and deprived you\nof the reward. As it is, I shall go down and finish the thing off",
        "to-night with a clear conscience.\"\n\n\"You can't mean that you dream of going down to the museum\nto-night!\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"But it's madness!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, to-night is the one night when there ought to\nbe no risk at all.\"\n\n\"After what happened last night?\"\n\n\"Because of what happened last night. Do you imagine Mr. Baxter\nwill dare to stir from his bed after that? If ever there was a\nchance of getting this thing finished, it will be to-night.\"",
        "\"You're quite right. I never looked at it in that way. Baxter\nwouldn't risk a second disaster. I'll certainly make a success of\nit this time.\"\n\nJoan raised her eyebrows.\n\n\"I don't quite understand you, Mr. Marson. Do you propose to try\nto get the scarab to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes. It will be as easy as--\"\n\n\"Are you forgetting that, by the terms of our agreement, it is my\nturn?\"\n\n\"You surely don't intend to hold me to that?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"",
        "\"But, good heavens, consider my position! Do you seriously expect\nme to lie in bed while you do all the work, and then to take a\nhalf share in the reward?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"It's ridiculous!\"\n\n\"It's no more ridiculous than that I should do the same. Mr.\nMarson, there's no use in our going over all this again. We\nsettled it long ago.\"\n\nJoan refused to discuss the matter further, leaving Ashe in a\ncondition of anxious misery comparable only to that which, as",
        "night began to draw near, gnawed the vitals of the Efficient\nBaxter.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nBreakfast at Blandings Castle was an informal meal. There was\nfood and drink in the long dining-hall for such as were energetic\nenough to come down and get it; but the majority of the house\nparty breakfasted in their rooms, Lord Emsworth, whom nothing in\nthe world would have induced to begin the day in the company of a\ncrowd of his relations, most of whom he disliked, setting them",
        "the example.\n\nWhen, therefore, Baxter, yielding to Nature after having remained\nawake until the early morning, fell asleep at nine o'clock,\nnobody came to rouse him. He did not ring his bell, so he was not\ndisturbed; and he slept on until half past eleven, by which time,\nit being Sunday morning and the house party including one bishop\nand several of the minor clergy, most of the occupants of the\nplace had gone off to church.\n\nBaxter shaved and dressed hastily, for he was in state of nervous",
        "apprehension. He blamed himself for having lain in bed so long.\nWhen every minute he was away might mean the loss of the scarab,\nhe had passed several hours in dreamy sloth. He had wakened with\na presentiment. Something told him the scarab had been stolen in\nthe night, and he wished now that he had risked all and kept\nguard.\n\nThe house was very quiet as he made his way rapidly to the hall.\nAs he passed a window he perceived Lord Emsworth, in an",
        "un-Sabbatarian suit of tweeds and bearing a garden fork--which\nmust have pained the bishop--bending earnestly over a flower bed;\nbut he was the only occupant of the grounds, and indoors there\nwas a feeling of emptiness. The hall had that Sunday-morning air\nof wanting to be left to itself, and disapproving of the entry of\nanything human until lunch time, which can be felt only by a\nguest in a large house who remains at home when his fellows have\ngone to church.",
        "The portraits on the walls, especially the one of the Countess of\nEmsworth in the character of Venus rising from the sea, stared at\nBaxter as he entered, with cold reproof. The very chairs seemed\ndistant and unfriendly; but Baxter was in no mood to appreciate\ntheir attitude. His conscience slept. His mind was occupied, to\nthe exclusion of all other things, by the scarab and its probable\nfate. How disastrously remiss it had been of him not to keep",
        "guard last night! Long before he opened the museum door he was\nfeeling the absolute certainty that the worst had happened.\n\nIt had. The card which announced that here was an Egyptian scarab\nof the reign of Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty, presented by J.\nPreston Peters, Esquire, still lay on the cabinet in its wonted\nplace; but now its neat lettering was false and misleading. The\nscarab was gone.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nFor all that he had expected this, for all his premonition of",
        "disaster, it was an appreciable time before the Efficient Baxter\nrallied from the blow. He stood transfixed, goggling at the empty\nplace.\n\nThen his mind resumed its functions. All, he perceived, was not\nyet lost. Baxter the watchdog must retire, to be succeeded by\nBaxter the sleuthhound. He had been unable to prevent the theft\nof the scarab, but he might still detect the thief.\n\nFor the Doctor Watsons of this world, as opposed to the Sherlock",
        "Holmeses, success in the province of detective work must always\nbe, to a very large extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes\ncan extract a clew from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar ash;\nbut Doctor Watson has to have it taken out for him and dusted,\nand exhibited clearly, with a label attached.\n\nThe average man is a Doctor Watson. We are wont to scoff in a\npatronizing manner at that humble follower of the great\ninvestigator; but as a matter of fact we should have been just as",
        "dull ourselves. We should not even have risen to the modest\nheight of a Scotland Yard bungler.\n\nBaxter was a Doctor Watson. What he wanted was a clew; but it is\nso hard for the novice to tell what is a clew and what is not.\nAnd then he happened to look down--and there on the floor was a\nclew that nobody could have overlooked.\n\nBaxter saw it, but did not immediately recognize it for what it\nwas. What he saw, at first, was not a clew, but just a mess. He",
        "had a tidy soul and abhorred messes, and this was a particularly\nmessy mess. A considerable portion of the floor was a sea of red\npaint. The can from which it had flowed was lying on its\nside--near the wall. He had noticed that the smell of paint had\nseemed particularly pungent, but had attributed this to a new\nfreshet of energy on the part of Lord Emsworth. He had not\nperceived that paint had been spilled.\n\n\"Pah!\" said Baxter.\n\nThen suddenly, beneath the disguise of the mess, he saw the clew.",
        "A footmark! No less. A crimson footmark on the polished wood! It\nwas as clear and distinct as though it had been left there for\nthe purpose of assisting him. It was a feminine footmark, the\nprint of a slim and pointed shoe.\n\nThis perplexed Baxter. He had looked on the siege of the scarab\nas an exclusively male affair. But he was not perplexed long.\nWhat could be simpler than that Mr. Peters should have enlisted\nfemale aid? The female of the species is more deadly than the",
        "male. Probably she makes a better purloiner of scarabs. At any\nrate, there the footprint was, unmistakably feminine.\n\nInspiration came to him. Aline Peters had a maid! What more\nlikely than that secretly she should be a hireling of Mr. Peters,\non whom he had now come to look as a man of the blackest and most\nsinister character? Mr. Peters was a collector; and when a\ncollector makes up his mind to secure a treasure, he employs,\nBaxter knew, every possible means to that end.",
        "Baxter was now in a state of great excitement. He was hot on the\nscent and his brain was working like a buzz saw in an ice box.\nAccording to his reasoning, if Aline Peters' maid had done this\nthing there should be red paint in the hall marking her retreat,\nand possibly a faint stain on the stairs leading to the servants'\nbedrooms.\n\nHe hastened from the museum and subjected the hall to a keen\nscrutiny. Yes; there was red paint on the carpet. He passed",
        "through the green-baize door and examined the stairs. On the\nbottom step there was a faint but conclusive stain of crimson!\n\nHe was wondering how best to follow up this clew when he\nperceived Ashe coming down the stairs. Ashe, like Baxter, and as\nthe result of a night disturbed by anxious thoughts, had also\noverslept himself.\n\nThere are moments when the giddy excitement of being right on the\ntrail causes the amateur--or Watsonian--detective to be",
        "incautious. If Baxter had been wise he would have achieved his\nobject--the getting a glimpse of Joan's shoes--by a devious and\nsnaky route. As it was, zeal getting the better of prudence, he\nrushed straight on. His early suspicion of Ashe had been\ntemporarily obscured. Whatever Ashe's claims to be a suspect, it\nhad not been his footprint Baxter had seen in the museum.\n\n\"Here, you!\" said the Efficient Baxter excitedly.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"The shoes!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"",
        "\"I wish to see the servants' shoes. Where are they?\"\n\n\"I expect they have them on, sir.\"\n\n\"Yesterday's shoes, man--yesterday's shoes. Where are they?\"\n\n\"Where are the shoes of yesteryear?\" murmured Ashe. \"I should say\nat a venture, sir, that they would be in a large basket somewhere\nnear the kitchen. Our genial knife-and-shoe boy collects them, I\nbelieve, at early dawn.\"\n\n\"Would they have been cleaned yet?\"\n\n\"If I know the lad, sir--no.\"",
        "\"Go and bring that basket to me. Bring it to me in this room.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe room to which he referred was none other than the private\nsanctum of Mr. Beach, the butler, the door of which, standing\nopen, showed it to be empty. It was not Baxter's plan, excited as\nhe was, to risk being discovered sifting shoes in the middle of a\npassage in the servants' quarters.\n\nAshe's brain was working rapidly as he made for the shoe",
        "cupboard, that little den of darkness and smells, where Billy,\nthe knife-and-shoe boy, better known in the circle in which he\nmoved as Young Bonehead, pursued his menial tasks. What exactly\nwas at the back of the Efficient Baxter's mind prompting these\nmaneuvers he did not know; but that there was something he was\ncertain.\n\nHe had not yet seen Joan this morning, and he did not know\nwhether or not she had carried out her resolve of attempting to",
        "steal the scarab on the previous night; but this activity and\nmystery on the part of their enemy must have some sinister\nsignificance. He gathered up the shoe basket thoughtfully. He\nstaggered back with it and dumped it down on the floor of Mr.\nBeach's room. The Efficient Baxter stooped eagerly over it.\nAshe, leaning against the wall, straightened the creases in his\nclothes and flicked disgustedly at an inky spot which the journey\nhad transferred from the basket to his coat.",
        "\"We have here, sir,\" he said, \"a fair selection of our various\nfoot coverings.\"\n\n\"You did not drop any on your way?\"\n\n\"Not one, sir.\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter uttered a grunt of satisfaction and bent\nonce more to his task. Shoes flew about the room. Baxter knelt on\nthe floor beside the basket, and dug like a terrier at a rat\nhole. At last he made a find and with an exclamation of triumph\nrose to his feet. In his hand he held a shoe.\n\n\"Put those back,\" he said.",
        "Ashe began to pick up the scattered footgear.\n\n\"That's the lot, sir,\" he said, rising.\n\n\"Now come with me. Leave the basket there. You can carry it back\nwhen you return.\"\n\n\"Shall I put back that shoe, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I shall take this one with me.\"\n\n\"Shall I carry it for you, sir?\"\n\nBaxter reflected.\n\n\"Yes. I think that would be best.\"\n\nTrouble had shaken his nerve. He was not certain that there might\nnot be others besides Lord Emsworth in the garden; and it",
        "occurred to him that, especially after his reputation for\neccentric conduct had been so firmly established by his\nmisfortunes that night in the hall, it might cause comment should\nhe appear before them carrying a shoe.\n\nAshe took the shoe and, doing so, understood what before had\npuzzled him. Across the toe was a broad splash of red paint.\nThough he had nothing else to go on, he saw all. The shoe he held\nwas a female shoe. His own researches in the museum had made him",
        "aware of the presence there of red paint. It was not difficult to\nbuild up on these data a pretty accurate estimate of the position\nof affairs.\n\n\"Come with me,\" said Baxter.\n\nHe left the room. Ashe followed him.\n\nIn the garden Lord Emsworth, garden fork in hand, was dealing\nsummarily with a green young weed that had incautiously shown its\nhead in the middle of a flower bed. He listened to Baxter's\nstatement with more interest than he usually showed in anybody's",
        "statements. He resented the loss of the scarab, not so much on\naccount of its intrinsic worth as because it had been the gift of\nhis friend Mr. Peters.\n\n\"Indeed!\" he said, when Baxter had finished. \"Really? Dear me!\nIt certainly seems--It is extremely suggestive. You are certain\nthere was red paint on this shoe?\"\n\n\"I have it with me. I brought it on purpose to show you.\" He\nlooked at Ashe, who stood in close attendance. \"The shoe!\"\n\nLord Emsworth polished his glasses and bent over the exhibit.",
        "\"Ah!\" he said. \"Now let me look at--This, you say, is the--Just\nso; just so! Just--My dear Baxter, it may be that I have not\nexamined this shoe with sufficient care, but--Can you point out\nto me exactly where this paint is that you speak of?\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter stood staring at the shoe with wild, fixed\nstare. Of any suspicion of paint, red or otherwise, it was\nabsolutely and entirely innocent!\n\nThe shoe became the center of attraction, the center of all eyes.",
        "The Efficient Baxter fixed it with the piercing glare of one who\nfeels that his brain is tottering. Lord Emsworth looked at it\nwith a mildly puzzled expression. Ashe Marson examined it with a\nsort of affectionate interest, as though he were waiting for it\nto do a trick of some kind. Baxter was the first to break the\nsilence.\n\n\"There was paint on this shoe,\" he said vehemently. \"I tell you\nthere was a splash of red paint across the toe. This man here",
        "will bear me out in this. You saw paint on this shoe?\"\n\n\"Paint, sir?\"\n\n\"What! Do you mean to tell me you did not see it?\"\n\n\"No, sir; there was no paint on this shoe.\"\n\n\"This is ridiculous. I saw it with my own eyes. It was a broad\nsplash right across the toe.\"\n\nLord Emsworth interposed.\n\n\"You must have made a mistake, my dear Baxter. There is certainly\nno trace of paint on this shoe. These momentary optical delusions\nare, I fancy, not uncommon. Any doctor will tell you--\"",
        "\"I had an aunt, your lordship,\" said Ashe chattily, \"who was\nremarkably subject--\"\n\n\"It is absurd! I cannot have been mistaken,\" said Baxter. \"I am\npositively certain the toe of this shoe was red when I found it.\"\n\n\"It is quite black now, my dear Baxter.\"\n\n\"A sort of chameleon shoe,\" murmured Ashe.\n\nThe goaded secretary turned on him.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\nBaxter's old suspicion of this smooth young man came surging back\nto him.",
        "\"I strongly suspect you of having had something to do with this.\"\n\n\"Really, Baxter,\" said the earl, \"that is surely the least\nprobable of solutions. This young man could hardly have cleaned\nthe shoe on his way from the house. A few days ago, when painting\nin the museum, I inadvertently splashed some paint on my own\nshoe. I can assure you it does not brush off. It needs a very\nsystematic cleaning before all traces are removed.\"\n\n\"Exactly, your lordship,\" said Ashe. \"My theory, if I may--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"",
        "\"My theory, your lordship, is that Mr. Baxter was deceived by the\nlight-and-shade effects on the toe of the shoe. The morning sun,\nstreaming in through the window, must have shone on the shoe in\nsuch a manner as to give it a momentary and fictitious aspect of\nredness. If Mr. Baxter recollects, he did not look long at the\nshoe. The picture on the retina of the eye consequently had not\ntime to fade. I myself remember thinking at the moment that the",
        "shoe appeared to have a certain reddish tint. The mistake--\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Baxter shortly.\n\nLord Emsworth, now thoroughly bored with the whole affair and\ndesiring nothing more than to be left alone with his weeds and\nhis garden fork, put in his word. Baxter, he felt, was curiously\nirritating these days. He always seemed to be bobbing up. The\nEarl of Emsworth was conscious of a strong desire to be free from\nhis secretary's company. He was efficient, yes--invaluable",
        "indeed--he did not know what he should do without Baxter; but\nthere was no denying that his company tended after a while to\nbecome a trifle tedious. He took a fresh grip on his garden fork\nand shifted it about in the air as a hint that the interview had\nlasted long enough.\n\n\"It seems to me, my dear fellow,\" he said, \"the only explanation\nthat will square with the facts. A shoe that is really smeared\nwith red paint does not become black of itself in the course of a\nfew minutes.\"",
        "\"You are very right, your lordship,\" said Ashe approvingly. \"May\nI go now, your lordship?\"\n\n\"Certainly--certainly; by all means.\"\n\n\"Shall I take the shoe with me, your lordship?\"\n\n\"If you do not want it, Baxter.\"\n\nThe secretary passed the fraudulent piece of evidence to Ashe\nwithout a word; and the latter, having included both gentlemen in\na kindly smile, left the garden.\n\nOn returning to the butler's room, Ashe's first act was to remove",
        "a shoe from the top of the pile in the basket. He was about to\nleave the room with it, when the sound of footsteps in the\npassage outside halted him.\n\n\"I do not in the least understand why you wish me to come here,\nmy dear Baxter,\" said a voice, \"and you are completely spoiling\nmy morning, but--\"\n\nFor a moment Ashe was at a loss. It was a crisis that called for\nswift action, and it was a little hard to know exactly what to\ndo. It had been his intention to carry the paint-splashed shoe",
        "back to his own room, there to clean it at his leisure; but it\nappeared that his strategic line of retreat was blocked. Plainly,\nthe possibility--nay, the certainty--that Ashe had substituted\nanother shoe for the one with the incriminating splash of paint\non it had occurred to the Efficient Baxter almost directly the\nformer had left the garden.\n\nThe window was open. Ashe looked out. There were bushes below.\nIt was a makeshift policy, and one which did not commend itself",
        "to him as the ideal method, but it seemed the only thing to be\ndone, for already the footsteps had reached the door. He threw\nthe shoe out of window, and it sank beneath the friendly surface\nof the long grass round a wisteria bush.\n\nAshe turned, relieved, and the next moment the door opened and\nBaxter walked in, accompanied--with obvious reluctance---by his\nbored employer.\n\nBaxter was brisk and peremptory.\n\n\"I wish to look at those shoes again,\" he said coldly.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Ashe.",
        "\"I can manage without your assistance,\" said Baxter.\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nLeaning against the wall, Ashe watched him with silent interest,\nas he burrowed among the contents of the basket, like a terrier\ndigging for rats. The Earl of Emsworth took no notice of the\nproceedings. He yawned plaintively, and pottered about the room.\nHe was one of Nature's potterers.\n\nThe scrutiny of the man whom he had now placed definitely as a\nmalefactor irritated Baxter. Ashe was looking at him in an",
        "insufferably tolerant manner, as if he were an indulgent father\nbrooding over his infant son while engaged in some childish\nfrolic. He lodged a protest.\n\n\"Don't stand there staring at me!\"\n\n\"I was interested in what you were doing, sir.\"\n\n\"Never mind! Don't stare at me in that idiotic way.\"\n\n\"May I read a book, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, read if you like.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nAshe took a volume from the butler's slenderly stocked shelf. The\nshoe-expert resumed his investigations in the basket. He went",
        "through it twice, but each time without success. After the second\nsearch he stood up and looked wildly about the room. He was as\ncertain as he could be of anything that the missing piece of\nevidence was somewhere within those four walls. There was very\nlittle cover in the room, even for so small a fugitive as a shoe.\nHe raised the tablecloth and peered beneath the table.\n\n\"Are you looking for Mr. Beach, sir?\" said Ashe. \"I think he has\ngone to church.\"",
        "Baxter, pink with his exertions, fastened a baleful glance upon\nhim.\n\n\"You had better be careful,\" he said.\n\nAt this point the Earl of Emsworth, having done all the pottering\npossible in the restricted area, yawned like an alligator.\n\n\"Now, my dear Baxter--\" he began querulously.\n\nBaxter was not listening. He was on the trail. He had caught\nsight of a small closet in the wall, next to the mantelpiece, and\nit had stimulated him.\n\n\"What is in this closet?\"\n\n\"That closet, sir?\"",
        "\"Yes, this closet.\" He rapped the door irritably.\n\n\"I could not say, sir. Mr. Beach, to whom the closet belongs,\npossibly keeps a few odd trifles there. A ball of string,\nperhaps. Maybe an old pipe or something of that kind. Probably\nnothing of value or interest.\"\n\n\"Open it.\"\n\n\"It appears to be locked, sir--\"\n\n\"Unlock it.\"\n\n\"But where is the key?\"\n\nBaxter thought for a moment.\n\n\"Lord Emsworth,\" he said, \"I have my reasons for thinking that",
        "this man is deliberately keeping the contents of this closet from\nme. I am convinced that the shoe is in there. Have I your leave\nto break open the door?\"\n\nThe earl looked a little dazed, as if he were unequal to the\nintellectual pressure of the conversation.\n\n\"Now, my dear Baxter,\" said the earl impatiently, \"please tell me\nonce again why you have brought me in here. I cannot make head or\ntail of what you have been saying. Apparently you accuse this",
        "young man of keeping his shoes in a closet. Why should you\nsuspect him of keeping his shoes in a closet? And if he wishes to\ndo so, why on earth should not he keep his shoes in a closet?\nThis is a free country.\"\n\n\"Exactly, your lordship,\" said Ashe approvingly. \"You have\ntouched the spot.\"\n\n\"It all has to do with the theft of your scarab, Lord Emsworth.\nSomebody got into the museum and stole the scarab.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; ah, yes--so they did. I remember now. You told me.",
        "Bad business that, my dear Baxter. Mr. Peters gave me that\nscarab. He will be most deucedly annoyed if it's lost. Yes,\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Whoever stole it upset the can of red paint and stepped in it.\"\n\n\"Devilish careless of them. It must have made the dickens of a\nmess. Why don't people look where they are walking?\"\n\n\"I suspect this man of shielding the criminal by hiding her shoe\nin this closet.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not his own shoes that this young man keeps in\nclosets?\"",
        "\"It is a woman's shoe, Lord Emsworth.\"\n\n\"The deuce it is! Then it was a woman who stole the scarab? Is\nthat the way you figure it out? Bless my soul, Baxter, one\nwonders what women are coming to nowadays. It's all this\nmovement, I suppose. The Vote, and all that--eh? I recollect\nhaving a chat with the Marquis of Petersfield some time ago. He\nis in the Cabinet, and he tells me it is perfectly infernal the\nway these women carry on. He said sometimes it got to such a",
        "pitch, with them waving banners and presenting petitions, and\nthrowing flour and things at a fellow, that if he saw his own\nmother coming toward him, with a hand behind her back, he would\nrun like a rabbit. Told me so himself.\"\n\n\"So,\" said the Efficient Baxter, cutting in on the flow of\nspeech, \"what I wish to do is to break open this closet.\"\n\n\"Eh? Why?\"\n\n\"To get the shoe.\"\n\n\"The shoe? . . . Ah, yes, I recollect now. You were telling me.\"\n\n\"If your lordship has no objection.\"",
        "\"Objection, my dear fellow? None in the world. Why should I have\nany objection? Let me see! What is it you wish to do?\"\n\n\"This,\" said Baxter shortly.\n\nHe seized the poker from the fireplace and delivered two rapid\nblows on the closet door. The wood was splintered. A third blow\nsmashed the flimsy lock. The closet, with any skeletons it might\ncontain, was open for all to view.\n\nIt contained a corkscrew, a box of matches, a paper-covered copy",
        "of a book entitled \"Mary, the Beautiful Mill-Hand,\" a bottle of\nembrocation, a spool of cotton, two pencil-stubs, and other\nuseful and entertaining objects. It contained, in fact, almost\neverything except a paint-splashed shoe, and Baxter gazed at the\ncollection in dumb disappointment.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now, my dear Baxter,\" said the earl, \"or is\nthere any more furniture that you would like to break? You know,\nthis furniture breaking is becoming a positive craze with you, my",
        "dear fellow. You ought to fight against it. The night before\nlast, I don't know how many tables broken in the hall; and now\nthis closet. You will ruin me. No purse can stand the constant\ndrain.\"\n\nBaxter did not reply. He was still trying to rally from the blow.\nA chance remark of Lord Emsworth's set him off on the trail once\nmore. Lord Emsworth, having said his say, had dismissed the\naffair from his mind and begun to potter again. The course of his",
        "pottering had brought him to the fireplace, where a little pile\nof soot on the fender caught his eye. He bent down to inspect it.\n\n\"Dear me!\" he said. \"I must remember to tell Beach to have his\nchimney swept. It seems to need it badly.\"\n\nNo trumpet-call ever acted more instantaneously on old war-horse\nthan this simple remark on the Efficient Baxter. He was still\nconvinced that Ashe had hidden the shoe somewhere in the room,\nand, now that the closet had proved an alibi, the chimney was the",
        "only spot that remained unsearched. He dived forward with a rush,\nnearly knocking Lord Emsworth off his feet, and thrust an arm up\ninto the unknown. The startled peer, having recovered his\nbalance, met Ashe's respectfully pitying gaze.\n\n\"We must humor him,\" said the gaze, more plainly than speech.\n\nBaxter continued to grope. The chimney was a roomy chimney, and\nneeded careful examination. He wriggled his hand about\nclutchingly. From time to time soot fell in gentle showers.\n\n\"My dear Baxter!\"",
        "Baxter was baffled. He withdrew his hand from the chimney, and\nstraightened himself. He brushed a bead of perspiration from his\nface with the back of his hand. Unfortunately, he used the sooty\nhand, and the result was too much for Lord Emsworth's politeness.\nHe burst into a series of pleased chuckles.\n\n\"Your face, my dear Baxter! Your face! It is positively covered\nwith soot--positively! You must go and wash it. You are quite\nblack. Really, my dear fellow, you present rather an",
        "extraordinary appearance. Run off to your room.\"\n\nAgainst this crowning blow the Efficient Baxter could not stand\nup. It was the end.\n\n\"Soot!\" he murmured weakly. \"Soot!\"\n\n\"Your face is covered, my dear fellow--quite covered.\"\n\n\"It certainly has a faintly sooty aspect, sir,\" said Ashe.\n\nHis voice roused the sufferer to one last flicker of spirit.\n\n\"You will hear more of this,\" he said. \"You will--\"\n\nAt this moment, slightly muffled by the intervening door and",
        "passageway, there came from the direction of the hall a sound\nlike the delivery of a ton of coal. A heavy body bumped down the\nstairs, and a voice which all three recognized as that of the\nHonorable Freddie uttered an oath that lost itself in a final\ncrash and a musical splintering sound, which Baxter for one had\nno difficulty in recognizing as the dissolution of occasional\nchina.\n\nEven if they had not so able a detective as Baxter with them,",
        "Lord Emsworth and Ashe would have been at no loss to guess what\nhad happened. Doctor Watson himself could have deduced it from\nthe evidence. The Honorable Freddie had fallen downstairs.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nWith a little ingenuity this portion of the story of Mr. Peters'\nscarab could be converted into an excellent tract, driving home\nthe perils, even in this world, of absenting one's self from\nchurch on Sunday morning. If the Honorable Freddie had gone to",
        "church he would not have been running down the great staircase at\nthe castle at this hour; and if he had not been running down the\ngreat staircase at the castle at that hour he would not have\nencountered Muriel.\n\nMuriel was a Persian cat belonging to Lady Ann Warblington. Lady\nAnn had breakfasted in bed and lain there late, as she rather\nfancied she had one of her sick headaches coming on. Muriel had\nleft her room in the wake of the breakfast tray, being anxious to",
        "be present at the obsequies of a fried sole that had formed Lady\nAnn's simple morning meal, and had followed the maid who bore it\nuntil she had reached the hall.\n\nAt this point the maid, who disliked Muriel, stopped and made a\nnoise like an exploding pop bottle, at the same time taking a\nlittle run in Muriel's direction and kicking at her with a\nmenacing foot. Muriel, wounded and startled, had turned in her\ntracks and sprinted back up the staircase at the exact moment",
        "when the Honorable Freddie, who for some reason was in a great\nhurry, ran lightly down.\n\nThere was an instant when Freddie could have saved himself by\nplanting a number-ten shoe on Muriel's spine, but even in that\ncrisis he bethought him that he hardly stood solid enough with\nthe authorities to risk adding to his misdeeds the slaughter of\nhis aunt's favorite cat, and he executed a rapid swerve. The\nspared cat proceeded on her journey upstairs, while Freddie,",
        "touching the staircase at intervals, went on down.\n\nHaving reached the bottom, he sat amid the occasional china, like\nMarius among the ruins of Carthage, and endeavored to ascertain\nthe extent of his injuries. He had a dazed suspicion that he was\nirretrievably fractured in a dozen places. It was in this\nattitude that the rescue party found him. He gazed up at them\nwith silent pathos.\n\n\"In the name of goodness, Frederick,\" said Lord Emsworth\npeevishly, \"what do you imagine you are doing?\"",
        "Freddie endeavored to rise, but sank back again with a stifled\nhowl.\n\n\"It was that bally cat of Aunt Ann's,\" he said. \"It came legging\nit up the stairs. I think I've broken my leg.\"\n\n\"You have certainly broken everything else,\" said his father\nunsympathetically. \"Between you and Baxter, I wonder there's a\nstick of furniture standing in the house.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old chap,\" said Freddie gratefully as Ashe stepped\nforward and lent him an arm. \"I think my bally ankle must have",
        "got twisted. I wish you would give me a hand up to my room.\"\n\n\"And, Baxter, my dear fellow,\" said Lord Emsworth, \"you might\ntelephone to Doctor Bird, in Market Blandings, and ask him to be\ngood enough to drive out. I am sorry, Freddie,\" he added, \"that\nyou should have met with this accident; but--but everything is\nso--so disturbing nowadays that I feel--I feel most disturbed.\"\n\nAshe and the Honorable Freddie began to move across the",
        "hall--Freddie hopping, Ashe advancing with a sort of polka step.\nAs they reached the stairs there was a sound of wheels outside\nand the vanguard of the house party, returned from church,\nentered the house.\n\n\"It's all very well to give it out officially that Freddie has\nfallen downstairs and sprained his ankle,\" said Colonel Horace\nMant, discussing the affair with the Bishop of Godalming later in\nthe afternoon; \"but it's my firm belief that that fellow Baxter",
        "did precisely as I said he would--ran amuck and inflicted dashed\nfrightful injuries on young Freddie. When I got into the house\nthere was Freddie being helped up the stairs, while Baxter, with\nhis face covered with soot, was looking after him with a sort of\nevil grin. What had he smeared his face with soot for, I should\nlike to know, if he were perfectly sane?\n\n\"The whole thing is dashed fishy and mysterious and the sooner I\ncan get Mildred safely out of the place, the better I shall be",
        "pleased. The fellow's as mad as a hatter!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWhen Lord Emsworth, sighting Mr. Peters in the group of returned\nchurchgoers, drew him aside and broke the news that the valuable\nscarab, so kindly presented by him to the castle museum, had been\nstolen in the night by some person unknown, he thought the\nmillionaire took it exceedingly well. Though the stolen object no\nlonger belonged to him, Mr. Peters no doubt still continued to",
        "take an affectionate interest in it and might have been excused\nhad he shown annoyance that his gift had been so carelessly\nguarded.\n\nMr. Peters was, however, thoroughly magnanimous about the matter.\nHe deprecated the notion that the earl could possibly have\nprevented this unfortunate occurrence. He quite understood. He\nwas not in the least hurt. Nobody could have foreseen such a\ncalamity. These things happened and one had to accept them. He",
        "himself had once suffered in much the same way, the gem of his\ncollection having been removed almost beneath his eyes in the\nsmoothest possible fashion.\n\nAltogether, he relieved Lord Emsworth's mind very much; and when\nhe had finished doing so he departed swiftly and rang for Ashe.\nWhen Ashe arrived he bubbled over with enthusiasm. He was lyrical\nin his praise. He went so far as to slap Ashe on the back. It was\nonly when the latter disclaimed all credit for what had occurred",
        "that he checked the flow of approbation.\n\n\"It wasn't you who got it? Who was it, then?\"\n\n\"It was Miss Peters' maid. It's a long story; but we were working\nin partnership. I tried for the thing and failed, and she\nsucceeded.\"\n\nIt was with mixed feelings that Ashe listened while Mr. Peters\ntransferred his adjectives of commendation to Joan. He admired\nJoan's courage, he was relieved that her venture had ended\nwithout disaster, and he knew that she deserved whatever anyone",
        "could find to say in praise of her enterprise: but, at first,\nthough he tried to crush it down, he could not help feeling a\ncertain amount of chagrin that a girl should have succeeded where\nhe, though having the advantage of first chance, had failed. The\nterms of his partnership with Joan had jarred on him from the\nbeginning.\n\nA man may be in sympathy with the modern movement for the\nemancipation of woman and yet feel aggrieved when a mere girl",
        "proves herself a more efficient thief than himself. Woman is\ninvading man's sphere more successfully every day; but there are\nstill certain fields in which man may consider that he is\nrightfully entitled to a monopoly--and the purloining of scarabs\nin the watches of the night is surely one of them. Joan, in\nAshe's opinion, should have played a meeker and less active part.\n\nThese unworthy emotions did not last long. Whatever his other\nshortcomings, Ashe possessed a just mind. By the time he had",
        "found Joan, after Mr. Peters had said his say, and dispatched him\nbelow stairs for that purpose, he had purged himself of petty\nregrets and was prepared to congratulate her whole-heartedly. He\nwas, however, resolved that nothing should induce him to share in\nthe reward. On that point, he resolved, he would refuse to be\nshaken.\n\n\"I have just left Mr. Peters,\" he began. \"All is well. His check\nbook lies before him on the table and he is trying to make his",
        "fountain pen work long enough to write a check. But there is just\none thing I want to say--\"\n\nShe interrupted him. To his surprise, she was eyeing him coldly\nand with disapproval.\n\n\"And there is just one thing I want to say,\" she said; \"and that\nis, if you imagine I shall consent to accept a penny of the\nreward--\"\n\n\"Exactly what I was going to say. Of course I couldn't dream of\ntaking any of it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you. You are certainly going to have it all.",
        "I told you when we made our agreement that I should only take my\nshare if you let me do my share of the work. Now that you have\nbroken that agreement, nothing could induce me to take it. I know\nyou meant it kindly, Mr. Marson, but I simply can't feel\ngrateful. I told you that ours was a business contract and that I\nwouldn't have any chivalry; and I thought that after you had\ngiven me your promise--\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Ashe, bewildered. \"I can't follow this. What\ndo you mean?\"",
        "\"What do I mean? Why, that you went down to the museum last night\nbefore me and took the scarab, though you had promised to stay\naway and give me my chance.\"\n\n\"But I didn't do anything of the sort.\"\n\nIt was Joan's turn to look bewildered.\n\n\"But you have got the scarab, Mr. Marson?\"\n\n\"Why, you have got it!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"But--but it has gone!\"\n\n\"I know. I went down to the museum last night, as we had\narranged; and when I got there there was no scarab. It had\ndisappeared.\"",
        "They looked at each other in consternation. Ashe was the first to\nspeak.\n\n\"It was gone when you got to the museum?\"\n\n\"There wasn't a trace of it. I took it for granted that you had\nbeen down before me. I was furious!\"\n\n\"But this is ridiculous!\" said Ashe. \"Who can have taken it?\nThere was nobody beside ourselves who knew Mr. Peters was\noffering the reward. What exactly happened last night?\"\n\n\"I waited until one o'clock. Then I slipped down, got into the",
        "museum, struck a match, and looked for the scarab. It wasn't\nthere. I couldn't believe it at first. I struck some more\nmatches--quite a number--but it was no good. The scarab was gone;\nso I went back to bed and thought hard thoughts about you. It was\nsilly of me. I ought to have known you would not break your word;\nbut there didn't seem any other solution of the thing's\ndisappearance.\n\n\"Well, somebody must have taken it; and the question is, what are",
        "we to do?\" She laughed. \"It seems to me that we were a little\npremature in quarreling about how we are to divide that reward.\nIt looks as though there wasn't going to be any reward.\"\n\n\"Meantime,\" said Ashe gloomily, \"I suppose I have got to go back\nand tell Peters. I expect it will break his heart.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nBlandings Castle dozed in the calm of an English Sunday\nafternoon. All was peace. Freddie was in bed, with orders from\nthe doctor to stay there until further notice. Baxter had washed",
        "his face. Lord Emsworth had returned to his garden fork. The rest\nof the house party strolled about the grounds or sat in them, for\nthe day was one of those late spring days that are warm with a\npremature suggestion of midsummer.\n\nAline Peters was sitting at the open window of her bedroom, which\ncommanded an extensive view of the terraces. A pile of letters\nlay on the table beside her, for she had just finished reading\nher mail. The postman came late to the castle on Sundays and she",
        "had not been able to do this until luncheon was over.\n\nAline was puzzled. She was conscious of a fit of depression for\nwhich she could in no way account. She had a feeling that all was\nnot well with the world, which was the more remarkable in that\nshe was usually keenly susceptible to weather conditions and\nreveled in sunshine like a kitten. Yet here was a day nearly as\nfine as an American day--and she found no solace in it.\n\nShe looked down on the terrace; as she looked the figure of",
        "George Emerson appeared, walking swiftly. And at the sight of him\nsomething seemed to tell her that she had found the key to her\ngloom.\n\nThere are many kinds of walk. George Emerson's was the walk of\nmental unrest. His hands were clasped behind his back, his eyes\nstared straight in front of him from beneath lowering brows, and\nbetween his teeth was an unlighted cigar. No man who is not a\nprofessional politician holds an unlighted cigar in his mouth",
        "unless he wishes to irritate and baffle a ticket chopper in the\nsubway, or because unpleasant meditations have caused him to\nforget he has it there. Plainly, then, all was not well with\nGeorge Emerson.\n\nAline had suspected as much at luncheon; and looking back she\nrealized that it was at luncheon her depression had begun. The\ndiscovery startled her a little. She had not been aware, or she\nhad refused to admit to herself, that George's troubles bulked so",
        "large on her horizon. She had always told herself that she liked\nGeorge, that George was a dear old friend, that George amused and\nstimulated her; but she would have denied she was so wrapped up\nin George that the sight of him in trouble would be enough to\nspoil for her the finest day she had seen since she left America.\n\nThere was something not only startling but shocking in the\nthought; for she was honest enough with herself to recognize that",
        "Freddie, her official loved one, might have paced the grounds of\nthe castle chewing an unlighted cigar by the hour without\nstirring any emotion in her at all.\n\nAnd she was to marry Freddie next month! This was surely a matter\nthat called for thought. She proceeded, gazing down the while at\nthe perambulating George, to give it thought.\n\nAline's was not a deep nature. She had never pretended to herself\nthat she loved the Honorable Freddie in the sense in which the",
        "word is used in books. She liked him and she liked the idea of\nbeing connected with the peerage; her father liked the idea and\nshe liked her father. And the combination of these likings had\ncaused her to reply \"Yes\" when, last Autumn, Freddie, swelling\nhimself out like an embarrassed frog and gulping, had uttered\nthat memorable speech beginning, \"I say, you know, it's like\nthis, don't you know!\"--and ending, \"What I mean is, will you\nmarry me--what?\"",
        "She had looked forward to being placidly happy as the Honorable\nMrs. Frederick Threepwood. And then George Emerson had reappeared\nin her life, a disturbing element.\n\nUntil to-day she would have resented the suggestion that she was\nin love with George. She liked to be with him, partly because he\nwas so easy to talk to, and partly because it was exciting to be\ncontinually resisting the will power he made no secret of trying\nto exercise. But to-day there was a difference. She had suspected",
        "it at luncheon and she realized it now. As she looked down at him\nfrom behind the curtain, and marked his air of gloom, she could\nno longer disguise it from herself.\n\nShe felt maternal--horribly maternal. George was in trouble and\nshe wanted to comfort him.\n\nFreddie, too, was in trouble. But did she want to comfort\nFreddie? No. On the contrary, she was already regretting her\npromise, so lightly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him",
        "that afternoon. A well-marked feeling of annoyance that he should\nhave been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle\nwas her chief sentiment respecting Freddie.\n\nGeorge Emerson continued to perambulate and Aline continued to\nwatch him. At last she could endure it no longer. She gathered up\nher letters, stacked them in a corner of the dressing-table and\nleft the room. George had reached the end of the terrace and\nturned when she began to descend the stone steps outside the",
        "front door. He quickened his pace as he caught sight of her. He\nhalted before her and surveyed her morosely.\n\n\"I have been looking for you,\" he said.\n\n\"And here I am. Cheer up, George! Whatever is the matter? I've\nbeen sitting in my room looking at you, and you have been simply\nprowling. What has gone wrong?\"\n\n\"Everything!\"\n\n\"How do you mean--everything?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I say. I'm done for. Read this.\"\n\nAline took the yellow slip of paper. \"A cable,\" added George. \"I",
        "got it this morning--mailed on from my rooms in London. Read it.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to. It doesn't seem to make sense.\"\n\nGeorge laughed grimly.\n\n\"It makes sense all right.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can say that. 'Meredith elephant\nkangaroo--?'\"\n\n\"Office cipher; I was forgetting. 'Elephant' means 'Seriously ill\nand unable to attend to duty.' Meredith is one of the partners in\nmy firm in New York.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you think he is very sick? Are you very\nfond of Mr. Meredith?\"",
        "\"Meredith is a good fellow and I like him; but if it was simply a\nmatter of his being ill I'm afraid I could manage to bear up\nunder the news. Unfortunately 'kangaroo' means 'Return, without\nfail, by the next boat.'\"\n\n\"You must return by the next boat?\" Aline looked at him, in her\neyes a slow-growing comprehension of the situation. \"Oh!\" she\nsaid at length.\n\n\"I put it stronger than that,\" said George.\n\n\"But--the next boat---- That means on Wednesday.\"",
        "\"Wednesday morning, from Southampton. I shall have to leave here\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAline's eyes were fixed on the blue hills across the valley, but\nshe did not see them. There was a mist between. She was feeling\ncrushed and ill-treated and lonely. It was as though George was\nalready gone and she left alone in an alien land.\n\n\"But, George!\" she said; she could find no other words for her\nprotest against the inevitable.\n\n\"It's bad luck,\" said Emerson quietly; \"but I shouldn't wonder if",
        "it is not the best thing that really could have happened. It\nfinishes me cleanly, instead of letting me drag on and make both\nof us miserable. If this cable hadn't come I suppose I should\nhave gone on bothering you up to the day of your wedding. I\nshould have fancied, to the last moment, that there was a chance\nfor me; but this ends me with one punch.\n\n\"Even I haven't the nerve to imagine that I can work a miracle in\nthe few hours before the train leaves to-morrow. I must just make",
        "the best of it. If we ever meet again--and I don't see why we\nshould--you will be married. My particular brand of mental\nsuggestion doesn't work at long range. I shan't hope to influence\nyou by telepathy.\"\n\nHe leaned on the balustrade at her side and spoke in a low, level\nvoice.\n\n\"This thing,\" he said, \"coming as a shock, coming out of the blue\nsky without warning--Meredith is the last man in the world you\nwould expect to crack up; he looked as fit as a dray horse the",
        "last time I saw him--somehow seems to have hammered a certain\namount of sense into me. Odd it never struck me before; but I\nsuppose I have been about the most bumptious, conceited fool that\never happened.\n\n\"Why I should have imagined that there was a sort of irresistible\nfascination in me, which was bound to make you break off your\nengagement and upset the whole universe simply to win the\nwonderful reward of marrying me, is more than I can understand. I",
        "suppose it takes a shock to make a fellow see exactly what he\nreally amounts to. I couldn't think any more of you than I do;\nbut, if I could, the way you have put up with my mouthing and\nswaggering and posing as a sort of superman, would make me do it.\nYou have been wonderful!\"\n\nAline could not speak. She felt as though her whole world had\nbeen turned upside down in the last quarter of an hour. This was\na new George Emerson, a George at whom it was impossible to",
        "laugh, but an insidiously attractive George. Her heart beat\nquickly. Her mind was not clear; but dimly she realized that he\nhad pulled down her chief barrier of defense and that she was\nmore open to attack than she had ever been. Obstinacy, the\nautomatic desire to resist the pressure of a will that attempted\nto overcome her own, had kept her cool and level-headed in the\npast. With masterfulness she had been able to cope. Humility was\nanother thing altogether.",
        "Soft-heartedness was Aline's weakness. She had never clearly\nrecognized it, but it had been partly pity that had induced her\nto accept Freddie; he had seemed so downtrodden and sorry for\nhimself during those Autumn days when they had first met.\nPrudence warned her that strange things might happen if once she\nallowed herself to pity George Emerson.\n\nThe silence lengthened. Aline could find nothing to say. In her\npresent mood there was danger in speech.",
        "\"We have known each other so long,\" said Emerson, \"and I have\ntold you so often that I love you, we have come to make almost a\njoke of it, as though we were playing some game. It just happens\nthat that is our way--to laugh at things; but I am going to say\nit once again, even though it has come to be a sort of catch\nphrase. I love you! I'm reconciled to the fact that I am done\nfor, out of the running, and that you are going to marry somebody\nelse; but I am not going to stop loving you.",
        "\"It isn't a question of whether I should be happier if I forgot\nyou. I can't do it. It's just an impossibility--and that's all\nthere is to it. Whatever I may be to you, you are part of me, and\nyou always will be part of me. I might just as well try to go on\nliving without breathing as living without loving you.\"\n\nHe stopped and straightened himself.\n\n\"That's all! I don't want to spoil a perfectly good Spring\nafternoon for you by pulling out the tragic stop. I had to say",
        "all that; but it's the last time. It shan't occur again. There\nwill be no tragedy when I step into the train to-morrow. Is there\nany chance that you might come and see me off?\"\n\nAline nodded.\n\n\"You will? That will be splendid! Now I'll go and pack and break\nit to my host that I must leave him. I expect, it will be news to\nhim to learn that I am here. I doubt if he knows me by sight.\"\n\nAline stood where he had left her, leaning on the balustrade. In",
        "the fullness of time there came to her the recollection she had\npromised Freddie that shortly after luncheon she would sit with\nhim.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nThe Honorable Freddie, draped in purple pyjamas and propped up\nwith many pillows, was lying in bed, reading Gridley Quayle,\nInvestigator. Aline's entrance occurred at a peculiarly poignant\nmoment in the story and gave him a feeling of having been brought\nviolently to earth from a flight in the clouds. It is not often",
        "an author has the good fortune to grip a reader as the author of\nGridley Quayle gripped Freddie.\n\nOne of the results of his absorbed mood was that he greeted Aline\nwith a stare of an even glassier quality than usual. His eyes\nwere by nature a trifle prominent; and to Aline, in the\noverstrung condition in which her talk with George Emerson had\nleft her, they seemed to bulge at her like a snail's. A man\nseldom looks his best in bed, and to Aline, seeing him for the",
        "first time at this disadvantage, the Honorable Freddie seemed\nquite repulsive. It was with a feeling of positive panic that she\nwondered whether he would want her to kiss him.\n\nFreddie made no such demand. He was not one of your demonstrative\nlovers. He contented himself with rolling over in bed and\ndropping his lower jaw.\n\n\"Hello, Aline!\"\n\nAline sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\n\"Well, Freddie?\"\n\nHer betrothed improved his appearance a little by hitching up his",
        "jaw. As though feeling that would be too extreme a measure, he\ndid not close his mouth altogether; but he diminished the abyss.\nThe Honorable Freddie belonged to the class of persons who move\nthrough life with their mouths always restfully open.\n\nIt seemed to Aline that on this particular afternoon a strange\ndumbness had descended on her. She had been unable to speak to\nGeorge and now she could not think of anything to say to Freddie.\nShe looked at him and he looked at her; and the clock on the",
        "mantel-piece went on ticking.\n\n\"It was that bally cat of Aunt Ann's,\" said Freddie at length,\nessaying light conversation. \"It came legging it up the stairs\nand I took the most frightful toss. I hate cats! Do you hate\ncats? I knew a fellow in London who couldn't stand cats.\"\n\nAline began to wonder whether there was not something permanently\nwrong with her organs of speech. It should have been a simple\nmatter to develop the cat theme, but she found herself unable to",
        "do so. Her mind was concentrated, to the exclusion of all else,\non the repellent nature of the spectacle provided by her loved\none in pyjamas. Freddie resumed the conversation.\n\n\"I was just reading a corking book. Have you ever read these\nthings? They come out every month, and they're corking. The\nfellow who writes them must be a corker. It beats me how he\nthinks of these things. They are about a detective--a chap called\nGridley Quayle. Frightfully exciting!\"",
        "An obvious remedy for dumbness struck Aline.\n\n\"Shall I read to you, Freddie?\"\n\n\"Right-ho! Good scheme! I've got to the top of this page.\"\n\nAline took the paper-covered book.\n\n\"'Seven guns covered him with deadly precision.' Did you get as\nfar as that?\"\n\n\"Yes; just beyond. It's a bit thick, don't you know! This chappie\nQuayle has been trapped in a lonely house, thinking he was going\nto see a pal in distress; and instead of the pal there pop out a",
        "whole squad of masked blighters with guns. I don't see how he's\ngoing to get out of it, myself; but I'll bet he does. He's a\ncorker!\"\n\nIf anybody could have pitied Aline more than she pitied herself,\nas she waded through the adventures of Mr. Quayle, it would have\nbeen Ashe Marson. He had writhed as he wrote the words and she\nwrithed as she read them. The Honorable Freddie also writhed, but\nwith tense excitement.\n\n\"What's the matter? Don't stop!\" he cried as Aline's voice\nceased.",
        "\"I'm getting hoarse, Freddie.\"\n\nFreddie hesitated. The desire to remain on the trail with Gridley\nstruggled with rudimentary politeness.\n\n\"How would it be--Would you mind if I just took a look at the\nrest of it myself? We could talk afterward, you know. I shan't be\nlong.\"\n\n\"Of course! Do read if you want to. But do you really like this\nsort of thing, Freddie?\"\n\n\"Me? Rather! Why--don't you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It seems a little--I don't know.\"",
        "Freddie had become absorbed in his story. Aline did not attempt\nfurther analysis of her attitude toward Mr. Quayle; she relapsed\ninto silence.\n\nIt was a silence pregnant with thought. For the first time in\ntheir relations, she was trying to visualize to herself exactly\nwhat marriage with this young man would mean. Hitherto, it struck\nher, she had really seen so little of Freddie that she had\nscarcely had a chance of examining him. In the crowded world",
        "outside he had always seemed a tolerable enough person. To-day,\nsomehow, he was different. Everything was different to-day.\n\nThis, she took it, was a fair sample of what she might expect\nafter marriage. Marriage meant--to come to essentials--that two\npeople were very often and for lengthy periods alone together,\ndependent on each other for mutual entertainment. What exactly\nwould it be like, being alone often and for lengthy periods with\nFreddie? Well, it would, she assumed, be like this.",
        "\"It's all right,\" said Freddie without looking up. \"He did get\nout! He had a bomb on him, and he threatened to drop it and blow\nthe place to pieces unless the blighters let him go. So they\ncheesed it. I knew he had something up his sleeve.\"\n\nLike this! Aline drew a deep breath. It would be like\nthis--forever and ever and ever--until she died. She bent forward\nand stared at him.\n\n\"Freddie,\" she said, \"do you love me?\" There was no reply.",
        "\"Freddie, do you love me? Am I a part of you? If you hadn't me\nwould it be like trying to go on living without breathing?\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie raised a flushed face and gazed at her with\nan absent eye.\n\n\"Eh? What?\" he said. \"Do I--Oh; yes, rather! I say, one of the\nblighters has just loosed a rattlesnake into Gridley Quayle's\nbedroom through the transom!\"\n\nAline rose from her seat and left the room softly. The Honorable\nFreddie read on, unheeding.\n\n                        *   *   *",
        "Ashe Marson had not fallen far short of the truth in his estimate\nof the probable effect on Mr. Peters of the information that his\nprecious scarab had once more been removed by alien hands and was\nnow farther from his grasp than ever. A drawback to success in\nlife is that failure, when it does come, acquires an exaggerated\nimportance. Success had made Mr. Peters, in certain aspects of\nhis character, a spoiled child.\n\nAt the moment when Ashe broke the news he would have parted with",
        "half his fortune to recover the scarab. Its recovery had become a\npoint of honor. He saw it as the prize of a contest between his\nwill and that of whatever malignant powers there might be ranged\nagainst him in the effort to show him that there were limits to\nwhat he could achieve. He felt as he had felt in the old days\nwhen people sneaked up on him in Wall Street and tried to loosen\nhis grip on a railroad or a pet stock. He was suffering from that",
        "form of paranoia which makes men multimillionaires. Nobody would\nbe foolish enough to become a multimillionaire if it were not for\nthe desire to prove himself irresistible.\n\nMr. Peters obtained a small relief for his feelings by doubling\nthe existing reward, and Ashe went off in search of Joan, hoping\nthat this new stimulus, acting on their joint brains, might\ndevelop inspiration.\n\n\"Have any fresh ideas been vouchsafed to you?\" he asked. \"You may\nlook on me as baffled.\"\n\nJoan shook her head.",
        "\"Don't give up,\" she urged. \"Think again. Try to realize what\nthis means, Mr. Marson. Between us we have lost ten thousand\ndollars in a single night. I can't afford it. It is like losing a\nlegacy. I absolutely refuse to give in without an effort and go\nback to writing duke-and-earl stories for Home Gossip.\"\n\n\"The prospect of tackling Gridley Quayle again--\"\n\n\"Why, I was forgetting that you were a writer of detective\nstories. You ought to be able to solve this mystery in a moment.",
        "Ask yourself, 'What would Gridley Quayle have done?'\"\n\n\"I can answer that. Gridley Quayle would have waited helplessly\nfor some coincidence to happen to help him out.\"\n\n\"Had he no methods?\"\n\n\"He was full of methods; but they never led him anywhere without\nthe coincidence. However, we might try to figure it out. What\ntime did you get to the museum?\"\n\n\"One o'clock.\"\n\n\"And you found the scarab gone. What does that suggest to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. What does it suggest to you?\"",
        "\"Absolutely nothing. Let us try again. Whoever took the scarab\nmust have had special information that Peters was offering the\nreward.\"\n\n\"Then why hasn't he been to Mr. Peters and claimed it?\"\n\n\"True! That would seem to be a flaw in the reasoning. Once again:\nWhoever took it must have been in urgent and immediate need of\nmoney.\"\n\n\"And how are we to find out who was in urgent and immediate need\nof money?\"\n\n\"Exactly! How indeed?\"\n\nThere was a pause.",
        "\"I should think your Mr. Quayle must have been a great comfort to\nhis clients, wasn't he?\" said Joan.\n\n\"Inductive reasoning, I admit, seems to have fallen down to a\ncertain extent,\" said Ashe. \"We must wait for the coincidence. I\nhave a feeling that it will come.\" He paused. \"I am very\nfortunate in the way of coincidences.\"\n\n\"Are you?\"\n\nAshe looked about him and was relieved to find that they appeared\nto be out of earshot of their species. It was not easy to achieve",
        "this position at the castle if you happened to be there as a\ndomestic servant. The space provided for the ladies and gentlemen\nattached to the guests was limited, and it was rarely that you\ncould enjoy a stroll without bumping into a maid, a valet or a\nfootman; but now they appeared to be alone. The drive leading to\nthe back regions of the castle was empty. As far as the eye could\nreach there were no signs of servants--upper or lower.\nNevertheless, Ashe lowered his voice.",
        "\"Was it not a strange coincidence,\" he said, \"that you should\nhave come into my life at all?\"\n\n\"Not very,\" said Joan prosaically. \"It was quite likely that we\nshould meet sooner or later, as we lived on different floors of\nthe same house.\"\n\n\"It was a coincidence that you should have taken that room.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nAshe felt damped. Logically, no doubt, she was right; but surely\nshe might have helped him out a little in this difficult\nsituation. Surely her woman's intuition should have told her that",
        "a man who has been speaking in a loud and cheerful voice does\nnot lower it to a husky whisper without some reason. The\nhopelessness of his task began to weigh on him.\n\nEver since that evening at Market Blandings Station, when he\nrealized that he loved her, he had been trying to find an\nopportunity to tell her so; and every time they had met, the talk\nhad seemed to be drawn irresistibly into practical and\nunsentimental channels. And now, when he was doing his best to",
        "reason it out that they were twin souls who had been brought\ntogether by a destiny it would be foolish to struggle against;\nwhen he was trying to convey the impression that fate had designed\nthem for each other--she said, \"Why?\" It was hard.\n\nHe was about to go deeper into the matter when, from the\ndirection of the castle, he perceived the Honorable Freddie's\nvalet--Mr. Judson--approaching. That it was this repellent young\nman's object to break in on them and rob him of his one small",
        "chance of inducing Joan to appreciate, as he did, the mysterious\nworkings of Providence as they affected herself and him, was\nobvious. There was no mistaking the valet's desire for\nconversation. He had the air of one brimming over with speech.\nHis wonted indolence was cast aside; and as he drew nearer he\npositively ran. He was talking before he reached them.\n\n\"Miss Simpson, Mr. Marson, it's true--what I said that night.\nIt's a fact!\"",
        "Ashe regarded the intruder with a malevolent eye. Never fond of\nMr. Judson, he looked on him now with positive loathing. It had\nnot been easy for him to work himself up to the point where he\ncould discuss with Joan the mysterious ways of Providence, for\nthere was that about her which made it hard to achieve sentiment.\nThat indefinable something in Joan Valentine which made for\nnocturnal raids on other people's museums also rendered her a\nsomewhat difficult person to talk to about twin souls and",
        "destiny. The qualities that Ashe loved in her--her strength, her\ncapability, her valiant self-sufficingness--were the very\nqualities which seemed to check him when he tried to tell her\nthat he loved them.\n\nMr. Judson was still babbling.\n\n\"It's true. There ain't a doubt of it now. It's been and happened\njust as I said that night.\"\n\n\"What did you say? Which night?\" inquired Ashe.\n\n\"That night at dinner--the first night you two came here. Don't",
        "you remember me talking about Freddie and the girl he used to\nwrite letters to in London--the girl I said was so like you, Miss\nSimpson? What was her name again? Joan Valentine. That was it.\nThe girl at the theater that Freddie used to send me with letters\nto pretty nearly every evening. Well, she's been and done it,\nsame as I told you all that night she was jolly likely to go and\ndo. She's sticking young Freddie up for his letters, just as he",
        "ought to have known she would do if he hadn't been a young\nfathead. They're all alike, these girls--every one of them.\"\n\nMr. Judson paused, subjected the surrounding scenery to a\ncautious scrutiny and resumed.\n\n\"I took a suit of Freddie's clothes away to brush just now; and\nhappening\"--Mr. Judson paused and gave a little cough--\"happening\nto glance at the contents of his pockets I come across a letter.\nI took a sort of look at it before setting it aside, and it was",
        "from a fellow named Jones; and it said that this girl, Valentine,\nwas sticking onto young Freddie's letters what he'd written her,\nand would see him blowed if she parted with them under another\nthousand. And, as I made it out, Freddie had already given her\nfive hundred.\n\n\"Where he got it is more than I can understand; but that's what\nthe letter said. This fellow Jones said he had passed it to her\nwith his own hands; but she wasn't satisfied, and if she didn't",
        "get the other thousand she was going to bring an action for\nbreach. And now Freddie has given me a note to take to this\nJones, who is stopping in Market Blandings.\"\n\nJoan had listened to this remarkable speech with a stunned\namazement. At this point she made her first comment:\n\n\"But that can't be true.\"\n\n\"Saw the letter with my own eyes, Miss Simpson.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\nShe looked at Ashe helplessly. Their eyes met--hers wide with\nperplexity, his bright with the light of comprehension.",
        "\"It shows,\" said Ashe slowly, \"that he was in immediate and\nurgent need of money.\"\n\n\"You bet it does,\" said Mr. Judson with relish. \"It looks to me\nas though young Freddie had about reached the end of his tether\nthis time. My word! There won't half be a kick-up if she does sue\nhim for breach! I'm off to tell Mr. Beach and the rest. They'll\njump out of their skins.\" His face fell. \"Oh, Lord, I was\nforgetting this note. He told me to take it at once.\"",
        "\"I'll take it for you,\" said Ashe. \"I'm not doing anything.\"\n\nMr. Judson's gratitude was effusive.\n\n\"You're a good fellow, Marson,\" he said. \"I'll do as much for you\nanother time. I couldn't hardly bear not to tell a bit of news\nlike this right away. I should burst or something.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Judson, with shining face, hurried off to the\nhousekeeper's room.\n\n\"I simply can't understand it,\" said Joan at length. \"My head is\ngoing round.\"\n\n\"Can't understand it? Why, it's perfectly clear. This is the",
        "coincidence for which, in my capacity of Gridley Quayle, I was\nwaiting. I can now resume inductive reasoning. Weighing the\nevidence, what do we find? That young sweep, Freddie, is the man.\nHe has the scarab.\"\n\n\"But it's all such a muddle. I'm not holding his letters.\"\n\n\"For Jones' purposes you are. Let's get this Jones element in the\naffair straightened out. What do you know of him?\"\n\n\"He was an enormously fat man who came to see me one night and",
        "said he had been sent to get back some letters. I told him I had\ndestroyed them ages ago and he went away.\"\n\n\"Well, that part of it is clear, then. He is working a simple but\ningenious game on Freddie. It wouldn't succeed with everybody, I\nsuppose; but from what I have seen and heard of him Freddie isn't\nstrong on intellect. He seems to have accepted the story without\na murmur. What does he do? He has to raise a thousand pounds\nimmediately, and the raising of the first five hundred has",
        "exhausted his credit. He gets the idea of stealing the scarab!\"\n\n\"But why? Why should he have thought of the scarab at all? That\nis what I can't understand. He couldn't have meant to give it to\nMr. Peters and claim the reward. He couldn't have known that Mr.\nPeters was offering a reward. He couldn't have known that Lord\nEmsworth had not got the scarab quite properly. He couldn't have\nknown--he couldn't have known anything!\"\n\nAshe's enthusiasm was a trifle damped.",
        "\"There's something in that. But--I have it! Jones must have known\nabout the scarab and told him.\"\n\n\"But how could he have known?\"\n\n\"Yes; there's something in that, too. How could Jones have\nknown?\"\n\n\"He couldn't. He had gone by the time Aline came that night.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand. Which night?\"\n\n\"It was the night of the day I first met you. I was wondering for\na moment whether he could by any chance have overheard Aline\ntelling me about the scarab and the reward Mr. Peters was",
        "offering for it.\"\n\n\"Overheard! That word is like a bugle blast to me. Nine out of\nten of Gridley Quayle's triumphs were due to his having overheard\nsomething. I think we are now on the right track.\"\n\n\"I don't. How could he have overheard us? The door was closed and\nhe was in the street by that time.\"\n\n\"How do you know he was in the street? Did you see him out?\"\n\n\"No; but he went.\"\n\n\"He might have waited on the stairs--you remember how dark they\nare at Number Seven--and listened.\"\n\n\"Why?\"",
        "Ashe reflected.\n\n\"Why? Why? What a beast of a word that is--the detective's\nbugbear. I thought I had it, until you said--Great Scott! I'll\ntell you why. I see it all. I have him with the goods. His object\nin coming to see you about the letters was because Freddie wanted\nthem back owing to his approaching marriage with Miss\nPeters--wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You tell him you have destroyed the letters. He goes off. Am I\nright?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Before he is out of the house Miss Peters is giving her name at",
        "the front door. Put yourself in Jones' place. What does he think?\nHe is suspicious. He thinks there is some game on. He skips\nupstairs again, waits until Miss Peters has gone into your room,\nthen stands outside and listens. How about that?\"\n\n\"I do believe you are right. He might quite easily have done\nthat.\"\n\n\"He did do exactly that. I know it as though I had been there; in\nfact, it is highly probable I was there. You say all this\nhappened on the night we first met? I remember coming downstairs",
        "that night--I was going out to a vaudeville show--and hearing\nvoices in your room. I remember it distinctly. In all probability\nI nearly ran into Jones.\"\n\n\"It does all seem to fit in, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It's a clear case. There isn't a flaw in it. The only question\nis, can I, on the evidence, go to young Freddie and choke the\nscarab out of him? On the whole, I think I had better take this\nnote to Jones, as I promised Judson, and see whether I can't work",
        "something through him. Yes; that's the best plan. I'll be\nstarting at once.\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nPerhaps the greatest hardship in being an invalid is the fact\nthat people come and see you and keep your spirits up. The\nHonorable Freddie Threepwood suffered extremely from this. His\nwas not a gregarious nature and it fatigued his limited brain\npowers to have to find conversation for his numerous visitors.\nAll he wanted was to be left alone to read the adventures of",
        "Gridley Quayle, and when tired of doing that to lie on his back\nand look at the ceiling and think of nothing.\n\nIt is your dynamic person, your energetic world's worker, who\nchafes at being laid up with a sprained ankle. The Honorable\nFreddie enjoyed it. From boyhood up he had loved lying in bed;\nand now that fate had allowed him to do this without incurring\nrebuke he objected to having his reveries broken up by officious\nrelations.\n\nHe spent his rare intervals of solitude in trying to decide in",
        "his mind which of his cousins, uncles and aunts was, all things\nconsidered, the greatest nuisance. Sometimes he would give the\npalm to Colonel Horace Mant, who struck the soldierly note--\"I\nrecollect in a hill campaign in the winter of the year '93 giving\nmy ankle the deuce of a twist.\" Anon the more spiritual attitude\nof the Bishop of Godalming seemed to annoy him more keenly.\n\nSometimes he would head the list with the name of his Cousin",
        "Percy--Lord Stockheath--who refused to talk of anything except\nhis late breach-of-promise case and the effect the verdict had\nhad on his old governor. Freddie was in no mood just now to be\nsympathetic with others on their breach-of-promise cases.\n\nAs he lay in bed reading on Monday morning, the only flaw in his\nenjoyment of this unaccustomed solitude was the thought that\npresently the door was bound to open and some kind inquirer\ninsinuate himself into the room.",
        "His apprehensions proved well founded. Scarcely had he got well\ninto the details of an ingenious plot on the part of a secret\nsociety to eliminate Gridley Quayle by bribing his cook--a bad\nlot--to sprinkle chopped-up horsehair in his chicken fricassee,\nwhen the door-knob turned and Ashe Marson came in.\n\nFreddie was not the only person who had found the influx of\nvisitors into the sick room a source of irritation. The fact that\nthe invalid seemed unable to get a moment to himself had annoyed",
        "Ashe considerably. For some little time he had hung about the\npassage in which Freddie's room was situated, full of enterprise,\nbut unable to make a forward move owing to the throng of\nsympathizers. What he had to say to the sufferer could not be\nsaid in the presence of a third party.\n\nFreddie's sensation, on perceiving him, was one of relief. He had\nbeen half afraid it was the bishop. He recognized Ashe as the\nvalet chappie who had helped him to bed on the occasion of his",
        "accident. It might be that he had come in a respectful way to\nmake inquiries, but he was not likely to stop long. He nodded and\nwent on reading. And then, glancing up, he perceived Ashe\nstanding beside the bed, fixing him with a piercing stare.\n\nThe Honorable Freddie hated piercing stares. One of the reasons\nwhy he objected to being left alone with his future\nfather-in-law, Mr. J. Preston Peters, was that Nature had given\nthe millionaire a penetrating pair of eyes, and the stress of",
        "business life in New York had developed in him a habit of boring\nholes in people with them. A young man had to have a stronger\nnerve and a clearer conscience than the Honorable Freddie to\nenjoy a tete-a-tete with Mr. Peters.\n\nThough he accepted Aline's father as a necessary evil and\nrecognized that his position entitled him to look at people as\nsharply as he liked, whatever their feelings, he would be hanged\nif he was going to extend this privilege to Mr. Peters' valet.",
        "This man standing beside him was giving him a look that seemed to\nhis sensitive imagination to have been fired red-hot from a gun;\nand this annoyed and exasperated Freddie.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he said querulously. \"What are you staring at\nme like that for?\"\n\nAshe sat down, leaned his elbows on the bed, and applied the look\nagain from a lower elevation.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said.\n\nWhatever may have been Ashe's defects, so far as the handling of\nthe inductive-reasoning side of Gridley Quayle's character was",
        "concerned, there was one scene in each of his stories in which he\nnever failed. That was the scene in the last chapter where\nQuayle, confronting his quarry, unmasked him. Quayle might have\nfloundered in the earlier part of the story, but in his big scene\nhe was exactly right. He was curt, crisp and mercilessly\ncompelling.\n\nAshe, rehearsing this interview in the passage before his entry,\nhad decided that he could hardly do better than model himself on",
        "the detective. So he began to be curt, crisp and mercilessly\ncompelling to Freddie; and after the first few sentences he had\nthat youth gasping for air.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" he said. \"If you can spare me a few moments of\nyour valuable time I will put the facts before you. Yes; press\nthat bell if you wish--and I will put them before witnesses. Lord\nEmsworth will no doubt be pleased to learn that his son, whom he\ntrusted, is a thief!\"\n\nFreddie's hand fell limply. The bell remained un-touched. His",
        "mouth opened to its fullest extent. In the midst of his panic he\nhad a curious feeling that he had heard or read that last\nsentence somewhere before. Then he remembered. Those very words\noccurred in Gridley Quayle, Investigator--The Adventure of the\nBlue Ruby.\n\n\"What--what do you mean?\" he stammered.\n\n\"I will tell you what I mean. On Saturday night a valuable scarab\nwas stolen from Lord Emsworth's private museum. The case was put\ninto my hands----\"\n\n\"Great Scott! Are you a detective?\"",
        "\"Ah!\" said Ashe.\n\nLife, as many a worthy writer has pointed out, is full of\nironies. It seemed to Freddie that here was a supreme example of\nthis fact. All these years he had wanted to meet a detective; and\nnow that his wish had been gratified the detective was detecting\nhim!\n\n\"The case,\" continued Ashe severely, \"was placed in my hands. I\ninvestigated it. I discovered that you were in urgent and\nimmediate need of money.\"\n\n\"How on earth did you do that?\"",
        "\"Ah!\" said Ashe. \"I further discovered that you were in\ncommunication with an individual named Jones.\"\n\n\"Good Lord! How?\"\n\nAshe smiled quietly.\n\n\"Yesterday I had a talk with this man Jones, who is staying in\nMarket Blandings. Why is he staying in Market Blandings? Because\nhe had a reason for keeping in touch with you; because you were\nabout to transfer to his care something you could get possession\nof, but which only he could dispose of--the scarab.\"",
        "The Honorable Freddie was beyond speech. He made no comment on\nthis statement. Ashe continued:\n\n\"I interviewed this man Jones. I said to him: 'I am in the\nHonorable Frederick Threepwood's confidence. I know everything.\nHave you any instructions for me?' He replied: 'What do you\nknow?' I answered: 'I know that the Honorable Frederick\nThreepwood has something he wishes to hand to you, but which he\nhas been unable to hand to you owing to having had an accident",
        "and being confined to his room.' He then told me to tell you to\nlet him have the scarab by messenger.\"\n\nFreddie pulled himself together with an effort. He was in sore\nstraits, but he saw one last chance. His researches in detective\nfiction had given him the knowledge that detectives occasionally\nrelaxed their austerity when dealing with a deserving case. Even\nGridley Quayle could sometimes be softened by a hard-luck story.\nFreddie could recall half a dozen times when a detected criminal",
        "had been spared by him because he had done it all from the best\nmotives. He determined to throw himself on Ashe's mercy.\n\n\"I say, you know,\" he said ingratiatingly, \"I think it's bally\nmarvelous the way you've deduced everything, and so on.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"But I believe you would chuck it if you heard my side of the\ncase.\"\n\n\"I know your side of the case. You think you are being\nblackmailed by a Miss Valentine for some letters you once wrote",
        "her. You are not. Miss Valentine has destroyed the letters. She\ntold the man Jones so when he went to see her in London. He kept\nyour five hundred pounds and is trying to get another thousand\nout of you under false pretenses.\"\n\n\"What? You can't be right.\"\n\n\"I am always right.\"\n\n\"You must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"I am never mistaken.\"\n\n\"But how do you know?\"\n\n\"I have my sources of information.\"\n\n\"She isn't going to sue me for breach of promise?\"\n\n\"She never had any intention of doing so.\"",
        "The Honorable Freddie sank back on the pillows.\n\n\"Good egg!\" he said with fervor. He beamed happily. \"This,\" he\nobserved, \"is a bit of all right.\"\n\nFor a space relief held him dumb. Then another aspect of the\nmatter struck him, and he sat up again with a jerk.\n\n\"I say, you don't mean to say that that rotter Jones was such a\nrotter as to do a rotten thing like that?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nFreddie grew plaintive.\n\n\"I trusted that man,\" he said. \"I jolly well trusted him\nabsolutely.\"",
        "\"I know,\" said Ashe. \"There is one born every minute.\"\n\n\"But\"--the thing seemed to be filtering slowly into Freddie's\nintelligence \"what I mean to say is, I--I--thought he was such a\ngood chap.\"\n\n\"My short acquaintance with Mr. Jones,\" said Ashe \"leads me to\nthink that he probably is--to himself.\"\n\n\"I won't have anything more to do with him.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Dash it, I'll tell you what I'll do. The very next time I meet\nthe blighter, I'll cut him dead. I will! The rotter! Five hundred",
        "quid he's had off me for nothing! And, if it hadn't been for you,\nhe'd have had another thousand! I'm beginning to think that my\nold governor wasn't so far wrong when he used to curse me for\ngoing around with Jones and the rest of that crowd. He knew a\nbit, by Gad! Well, I'm through with them. If the governor ever\nlets me go to London again, I won't have anything to do with\nthem. I'll jolly well cut the whole bunch! And to think that, if\nit hadn't been for you . . .\"",
        "\"Never mind that,\" said Ashe. \"Give me the scarab. Where is it?\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\"Restore it to its rightful owner.\"\n\n\"Are you going to give me away to the governor?\"\n\n\"I am not.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" said Freddie gratefully, \"that you are a dashed\ngood sort. You seem to me to have the making of an absolute\ntopper! It's under the mattress. I had it on me when I fell\ndownstairs and I had to shove it in there.\"\n\nAshe drew it out. He stood looking at it, absorbed. He could",
        "hardly believe his quest was at an end and that a small fortune\nlay in the palm of his hand. Freddie was eyeing him admiringly.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"I've always wanted to meet a detective.\nWhat beats me is how you chappies find out things.\"\n\n\"We have our methods.\"\n\n\"I believe you. You're a blooming marvel! What first put you on\nmy track?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Ashe, \"would take too long to explain. Of course I\nhad to do some tense inductive reasoning; but I cannot trace",
        "every link in the chain for you. It would be tedious.\"\n\n\"Not to me.\"\n\n\"Some other time.\"\n\n\"I say, I wonder whether you've ever read any of these\nthings--these Gridley Quayle stories? I know them by heart.\"\n\nWith the scarab safely in his pocket, Ashe could contemplate the\nbrightly-colored volume the other extended toward him without\nactive repulsion. Already he was beginning to feel a sort of\nsentiment for the depressing Quayle, as something that had once\nformed part of his life.",
        "\"Do you read these things?\"\n\n\"I should say not. I write them.\"\n\nThere are certain supreme moments that cannot be adequately\ndescribed. Freddie's appreciation of the fact that such a moment\nhad occurred in his life expressed itself in a startled cry and a\nconvulsive movement of all his limbs. He shot up from the pillows\nand gaped at Ashe.\n\n\"You write them? You don't mean, write them!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\"\n\nHe would have gone on, doubtless, to say more; but at this moment",
        "voices made themselves heard outside the door. There was a\nmovement of feet. Then the door opened and a small procession\nentered.\n\nIt was headed by the Earl of Emsworth. Following him came Mr.\nPeters. And in the wake of the millionaire were Colonel Horace\nMant and the Efficient Baxter. They filed into the room and stood\nby the bedside. Ashe seized the opportunity to slip out.\n\nFreddie glanced at the deputation without interest. His mind was",
        "occupied with other matters. He supposed they had come to inquire\nafter his ankle and he was mildly thankful that they had come in\na body instead of one by one. The deputation grouped itself about\nthe bed and shuffled its feet. There was an atmosphere of\nawkwardness.\n\n\"Er--Frederick!\" said Lord Emsworth. \"Freddie, my boy!\"\n\nMr. Peters fiddled dumbly with the coverlet. Colonel Mant cleared\nhis throat. The Efficient Baxter scowled. \"Er--Freddie, my dear",
        "boy, I fear we have a painful--er--task to perform.\"\n\nThe words struck straight home at the Honorable Freddie's guilty\nconscience. Had they, too, tracked him down? And was he now to be\naccused of having stolen that infernal scarab? A wave of relief\nswept over him as he realized that he had got rid of the thing. A\ndecent chappie like that detective would not give him away. All\nhe had to do was to keep his head and stick to stout denial. That\nwas the game--stout denial.",
        "\"I don't know what you mean,\" he said defensively.\n\n\"Of course you don't--dash it!\" said Colonel Mant. \"We're coming\nto that. And I should like to begin by saying that, though in a\nsense it was my fault, I fail to see how I could have acted---\"\n\n\"Horace!\"\n\n\"Oh, very well! I was only trying to explain.\"\n\nLord Emsworth adjusted his pince-nez and sought inspiration from\nthe wall paper.\n\n\"Freddie, my boy,\" he began, \"we have a somewhat unpleasant--a",
        "somewhat er--disturbing--We are compelled to break it to you. We\nare all most pained and astounded; and--\"\n\nThe Efficient Baxter spoke. It was plain he was in a bad temper.\n\n\"Miss Peters,\" he snapped, \"has eloped with your friend Emerson.\"\n\nLord Emsworth breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Exactly, Baxter. Precisely! You have put the thing in a\nnutshell. Really, my dear fellow, you are invaluable.\"\n\nAll eyes searched Freddie's face for signs of uncontrollable",
        "emotion. The deputation waited anxiously for his first\ngrief-stricken cry.\n\n\"Eh? What?\" said Freddie.\n\n\"It is quite true, Freddie, my dear boy. She went to London with\nhim on the ten-fifty.\"\n\n\"And if I had not been forcibly restrained,\" said Baxter acidly,\ncasting a vindictive look at Colonel Mant, \"I could have\nprevented it.\"\n\nColonel Mant cleared his throat again and put a hand to his\nmustache.\n\n\"I'm afraid that is true, Freddie. It was a most unfortunate",
        "misunderstanding. I'll tell you how it happened: I chanced to be\nat the station bookstall when the train came in. Mr. Baxter was\nalso in the station. The train pulled up and this young fellow\nEmerson got in--said good-by to us, don't you know, and got in.\nJust as the train was about to start, Miss Peters exclaiming,\n'George dear, I'm going with you---, dash it,' or some such\nspeech--proceeded to go--hell for leather--to the door of young\nEmerson's compartment. On which---\"",
        "\"On which,\" interrupted Baxter, \"I made a spring to try and catch\nher. Apart from any other consideration, the train was already\nmoving and Miss Peters ran considerable risk of injury. I had\nhardly moved when I felt a violent jerk at my ankle and fell to\nthe ground. After I had recovered from the shock, which was not\nimmediately, I found--\"\n\n\"The fact is, Freddie, my boy,\" the colonel went on, \"I acted\nunder a misapprehension. Nobody can be sorrier for the mistake",
        "than I; but recent events in this house had left me with the\nimpression that Mr. Baxter here was not quite responsible for his\nactions--overwork or something, I imagined. I have seen it happen\nso often in India, don't you know, where fellows run amuck and\nkick up the deuce's own delight. I am bound to admit that I have\nbeen watching Mr. Baxter rather closely lately in the expectation\nthat something of this very kind might happen.\n\n\"Of course I now realize my mistake; and I have apologized--",
        "apologized humbly--dash it! But at the moment I was firmly under\nthe impression that our friend here had an attack of some kind\nand was about to inflict injuries on Miss Peters. If I've seen it\nhappen once in India, I've seen it happen a dozen times.\n\n\"I recollect, in the hot weather of the year '99---or was it\n'93?--I think '93---one of my native bearers--However, I sprang\nforward and caught the crook of my walking stick on Mr. Baxter's",
        "ankle and brought him down. And by the time explanations were\nmade it was too late. The train had gone, with Miss Peters in\nit.\"\n\n\"And a telegram has just arrived,\" said Lord Emsworth, \"to say\nthat they are being married this afternoon at a registrar's. The\nwhole occurrence is most disturbing.\"\n\n\"Bear it like a man, my boy!\" urged Colonel Mant.\n\nTo all appearances Freddie was bearing it magnificently. Not a\nsingle exclamation, either of wrath or pain, had escaped his",
        "lips. One would have said the shock had stunned him or that he\nhad not heard, for his face expressed no emotion whatever.\n\nThe fact was, the story had made very little impression on the\nHonorable Freddie of any sort. His relief at Ashe's news about\nJoan Valentine; the stunning joy of having met in the flesh the\nauthor of the adventures of Gridley Quayle; the general feeling\nthat all was now right with the world--these things deprived him\nof the ability to be greatly distressed.",
        "And there was a distinct feeling of relief--actual relief--that\nnow it would not be necessary for him to get married. He had\nliked Aline; but whenever he really thought of it the prospect of\ngetting married rather appalled him. A chappie looked such an ass\ngetting married! It appeared, however, that some verbal comment\non the state of affairs was required of him. He searched his mind\nfor something adequate.\n\n\"You mean to say Aline has bolted with Emerson?\"",
        "The deputation nodded pained nods. Freddie searched in his mind\nagain. The deputation held its breath.\n\n\"Well, I'm blowed!\" said Freddie. \"Fancy that!\"\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nMr. Peters walked heavily into his room. Ashe Marson was waiting\nfor him there. He eyed Ashe dully.\n\n\"Pack!\" he said.\n\n\"Pack?\"\n\n\"Pack! We're getting out of here by the afternoon train.\"\n\n\"Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"My daughter has eloped with Emerson.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Don't stand there saying, 'What!' Pack.\"",
        "Ashe put his hand in his pocket.\n\n\"Where shall I put this?\" he asked.\n\nFor a moment Mr. Peters looked without comprehension at what Ashe\nwas holding out; then his whole demeanor altered. His eyes lit\nup. He uttered a howl of pure rapture:\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\n\"I got it.\"\n\n\"Where was it? Who took it? How did you choke it out of them?\nHow did you find it? Who had it?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I ought to say. I don't want to start\nanything. You won't tell anyone?\"",
        "\"Tell anyone! What do you take me for? Do you think I am going\nabout advertising this? If I can sneak out without that fellow\nBaxter jumping on my back I shall be satisfied. You can take it\nfrom me that there won't be any sensational exposures if I can\nhelp it. Who had it?\"\n\n\"Young Threepwood.\"\n\n\"Threepwood? Why did he want it?\"\n\n\"He needed money and he was going to raise it on--\"\n\nMr. Peters exploded.\n\n\"And I have been kicking because Aline can't marry him and has",
        "gone off with a regular fellow like young Emerson! He's a good\nboy--young Emerson. I knew his folks. He'll make a name for\nhimself one of these days. He's got get-up in him. And I have\nbeen waiting to shoot him because he has taken Aline away from\nthat goggle-eyed chump up in bed there!\n\n\"Why, if she had married Threepwood I should have had\ngrandchildren who would have sneaked my watch while I was dancing\nthem on my knee! There is a taint of some sort in the whole",
        "family. Father sneaks my Cheops and sonny sneaks it from father.\nWhat a gang! And the best blood in England! If that's England's\nidea of good blood give me Hoboken! This settles it. I was a\nchump ever to come to a country like this. Property isn't safe\nhere. I'm going back to America on the next boat.\n\n\"Where's my check book? I'm going to write you that check right\naway. You've earned it. Listen, young man; I don't know what your\nideas are, but if you aren't chained to this country I'll make it",
        "worth your while to stay on with me. They say no one's\nindispensable, but you come mighty near it. If I had you at my\nelbow for a few years I'd get right back into shape. I'm feeling\nbetter now than I have felt in years--and you've only just\nstarted in on me.\n\n\"How about it? You can call yourself what you like--secretary or\ntrainer, or whatever suits you best. What you will be is the\nfellow who makes me take exercise and stop smoking cigars, and",
        "generally looks after me. How do you feel about it?\"\n\nIt was a proposition that appealed both to Ashe's commercial and\nto his missionary instincts. His only regret had been that, the\nscarab recovered, he and Mr. Peters would now, he supposed, part\ncompany. He had not liked the idea of sending the millionaire\nback to the world a half-cured man. Already he had begun to look\non him in the light of a piece of creative work to which he had\njust set his hand.",
        "But the thought of Joan gave him pause. If this meant separation\nfrom Joan it was not to be considered.\n\n\"Let me think it over,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, think quick!\" said Mr. Peters.\n\n                        *   *   *\n\nIt has been said by those who have been through fires,\nearthquakes and shipwrecks that in such times of stress the\nsocial barriers are temporarily broken down, and the spectacle\nmay be seen of persons of the highest social standing speaking",
        "quite freely to persons who are not in society at all; and of\nquite nice people addressing others to whom they have never been\nintroduced. The news of Aline Peters' elopement with George\nEmerson, carried beyond the green-baize door by Slingsby, the\nchauffeur, produced very much the same state of affairs in the\nservants' quarters at Blandings Castle.\n\nIt was not only that Slingsby was permitted to penetrate into the\nhousekeeper's room and tell his story to his social superiors",
        "there, though that was an absolutely unprecedented occurrence;\nwhat was really extraordinary was that mere menials discussed the\naffair with the personal ladies and gentlemen of the castle\nguests, and were allowed to do so uncrushed. James, the\nfootman--that pushing individual--actually shoved his way into\nthe room, and was heard by witnesses to remark to no less a\nperson than Mr. Beach that it was a bit thick.\n\nAnd it is on record that his fellow footman, Alfred, meeting the",
        "groom of the chambers in the passage outside, positively prodded\nhim in the lower ribs, winked, and said: \"What a day we're\nhaving!\" One has to go back to the worst excesses of the French\nRevolution to parallel these outrages. It was held by Mr. Beach\nand Mrs. Twemlow afterward that the social fabric of the castle\nnever fully recovered from this upheaval. It may be they took an\nextreme view of the matter, but it cannot be denied that it",
        "wrought changes. The rise of Slingsby is a case in point. Until\nthis affair took place the chauffeur's standing had never been\nsatisfactorily settled. Mr. Beach and Mrs. Twemlow led the party\nwhich considered that he was merely a species of coachman; but\nthere was a smaller group which, dazzled by Slingsby's\npersonality, openly declared it was not right that he should take\nhis meals in the servants' hall with such admitted plebeians as\nthe odd man and the steward's-room footman.",
        "The Aline-George elopement settled the point once and for all.\nSlingsby had carried George's bag to the train. Slingsby had been\nstanding a few yards from the spot where Aline began her dash for\nthe carriage door. Slingsby was able to exhibit the actual half\nsovereign with which George had tipped him only five minutes\nbefore the great event. To send such a public man back to the\nservants' hall was impossible. By unspoken consent the chauffeur",
        "dined that night in the steward's room, from which he was never\ndislodged.\n\nMr. Judson alone stood apart from the throng that clustered about\nthe chauffeur. He was suffering the bitterness of the supplanted.\nA brief while before and he had been the central figure, with his\nstory of the letter he had found in the Honorable Freddie's coat\npocket. Now the importance of his story had been engulfed in that\nof this later and greater sensation, Mr. Judson was learning, for",
        "the first time, on what unstable foundations popularity stands.\n\nJoan was nowhere to be seen. In none of the spots where she might\nhave been expected to be at such a time was she to be found. Ashe\nhad almost given up the search when, going to the back door and\nlooking out as a last chance, he perceived her walking slowly on\nthe gravel drive.\n\nShe greeted Ashe with a smile, but something was plainly\ntroubling her. She did not speak for a moment and they walked\nside by side.",
        "\"What is it?\" said Ashe at length. \"What is the matter?\"\n\nShe looked at him gravely.\n\n\"Gloom,\" she said. \"Despondency, Mr. Marson--A sort of flat\nfeeling. Don't you hate things happening?\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"Well, this affair of Aline, for instance. It's so big it makes\none feel as though the whole world had altered. I should like\nnothing to happen ever, and life just to jog peacefully along.\nThat's not the gospel I preached to you in Arundell Street, is it!",
        "I thought I was an advanced apostle of action; but I seem to have\nchanged. I'm afraid I shall never be able to make clear what I do\nmean. I only know I feel as though I have suddenly grown old.\nThese things are such milestones. Already I am beginning to look\non the time before Aline behaved so sensationally as terribly\nremote. To-morrow it will be worse, and the day after that worse\nstill. I can see that you don't in the least understand what I\nmean.\"",
        "\"Yes; I do--or I think I do. What it comes to, in a few words, is\nthat somebody you were fond of has gone out of your life. Is that\nit?\"\n\nJoan nodded.\n\n\"Yes--at least, that is partly it. I didn't really know Aline\nparticularly well, beyond having been at school with her, but\nyou're right. It's not so much what has happened as what it\nrepresents that matters. This elopement has marked the end of a\nphase of my life. I think I have it now. My life has been such a",
        "series of jerks. I dash along--then something happens which stops\nthat bit of my life with a jerk; and then I have to start over\nagain--a new bit. I think I'm getting tired of jerks. I want\nsomething stodgy and continuous.\n\n\"I'm like one of the old bus horses that could go on forever if\npeople got off without making them stop. It's the having to get\nthe bus moving again that wears one out. This little section of\nmy life since we came here is over, and it is finished for good.",
        "I've got to start the bus going again on a new road and with a\nnew set of passengers. I wonder whether the old horses used to be\nsorry when they dropped one lot of passengers and took on a lot\nof strangers?\"\n\nA sudden dryness invaded Ashe's throat. He tried to speak, but\nfound no words. Joan went on:\n\n\"Do you ever get moods when life seems absolutely meaningless?\nIt's like a badly-constructed story, with all sorts of characters\nmoving in and out who have nothing to do with the plot. And when",
        "somebody comes along that you think really has something to do\nwith the plot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you begin to\nwonder what the story is about, and you feel that it's about\nnothing--just a jumble.\"\n\n\"There is one thing,\" said Ashe, \"that knits it together.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The love interest.\"\n\nTheir eyes met and suddenly there descended on Ashe confidence.\nHe felt cool and alert, sure of himself, as in the old days he\nhad felt when he ran races and, the nerve-racking hours of",
        "waiting past, he listened for the starter's gun. Subconsciously\nhe was aware he had always been a little afraid of Joan, and that\nnow he was no longer afraid.\n\n\"Joan, will you marry me?\"\n\nHer eyes wandered from his face. He waited.\n\n\"I wonder!\" she said softly. \"You think that is the solution?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How can you tell?\" she broke out. \"We scarcely know each other.\nI shan't always be in this mood. I may get restless again. I may\nfind it is the jerks that I really like.\"\n\n\"You won't!\"",
        "\"You're very confident.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely confident.\"\n\n\"'She travels fastest who travels alone,'\" misquoted Joan.\n\n\"What is the good,\" said Ashe, \"of traveling fast if you're going\nround in a circle? I know how you feel. I've felt the same\nmyself. You are an individualist. You think there is something\ntremendous just round the corner and that you can get it if you\ntry hard enough. There isn't--or if there is it isn't worth\ngetting. Life is nothing but a mutual aid association. I am going",
        "to help old Peters--you are going to help me--I am going to help\nyou.\"\n\n\"Help me to do what?\"\n\n\"Make life coherent instead of a jumble.\"\n\n\"Mr. Marson---\"\n\n\"Don't call me Mr. Marson.\"\n\n\"Ashe, you don't know what you are doing. You don't know me.\nI've been knocking about the world for five years and I'm\nhard--hard right through. I should make you wretched.\"\n\n\"You are not in the least hard--and you know it. Listen to me,\nJoan. Where's your sense of fairness? You crash into my life,",
        "turn it upside down, dig me out of my quiet groove, revolutionize\nmy whole existence; and now you propose to drop me and pay no\nfurther attention to me. Is it fair?\"\n\n\"But I don't. We shall always be the best of friends.\"\n\n\"We shall--but we will get married first.\"\n\n\"You are determined?\"\n\n\"I am!\"\n\nJoan laughed happily.\n\n\"How perfectly splendid! I was terrified lest I might have made\nyou change your mind. I had to say all I did to preserve my",
        "self-respect after proposing to you. Yes; I did. How strange it\nis that men never seem to understand a woman, however plainly she\ntalks! You don't think I was really worrying because I had lost\nAline, do you? I thought I was going to lose you, and it made me\nmiserable. You couldn't expect me to say it in so many words; but\nI thought--I was hoping--you guessed. I practically said it.\nAshe! What are you doing?\"\n\nAshe paused for a moment to reply.\n\n\"I am kissing you,\" he said.",
        "\"But you mustn't! There's a scullery maid or somebody looking\nthrough the kitchen window. She will see us.\"\n\nAshe drew her to him.\n\n\"Scullery maids have few pleasures,\" he said. \"Theirs is a dull\nlife. Let her see us.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Earl of Emsworth sat by the sick bed and regarded the\nHonorable Freddie almost tenderly.\n\n\"I fear, Freddie, my dear boy, this has been a great shock to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Eh? What? Yes--rather! Deuce of a shock, gov'nor.\"",
        "\"I have been thinking it over, my boy, and perhaps I have been a\nlittle hard on you. When your ankle is better I have decided to\nrenew your allowance; and you may return to London, as you do not\nseem happy in the country. Though how any reasonable being can\nprefer--\"\n\nThe Honorable Freddie started, pop-eyed, to a sitting posture.\n\n\"My word! Not really?\"\n\nHis father nodded.\n\n\"I say, gov'nor, you really are a topper! You really are, you",
        "know! I know just how you feel about the country and the jolly\nold birds and trees and chasing the bally slugs off the young\ngeraniums and all that sort of thing, but somehow it's never\nquite hit me the same way. It's the way I'm built, I suppose. I\nlike asphalt streets and crowds and dodging taxis and meeting\nchappies at the club and popping in at the Empire for half an\nhour and so forth. And there's something about having an\nallowance--I don't know . . . sort of makes you chuck your chest",
        "out and feel you're someone. I don't know how to thank you,\ngov'nor! You're--you're an absolute sportsman! This is the most\npriceless bit of work you've ever done. I feel like a\ntwo-year-old. I don't know when I've felt so braced.\nI--I--really, you know, gov'nor, I'm most awfully grateful.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lord Emsworth. \"Ah--precisely. But, Freddie, my\nboy,\" he added, not without pathos, \"there is just one thing\nmore. Do you think that--with an effort--for my sake--you could",

Wodehouse\n\nRelease date: June 1, 2000 [eBook #2233]\n                Most recently updated: August 4, 2017\n\nLanguage: English\n\nCredits: Produced by Jim Tinsley\n\n\n*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS ***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Jim Tinsley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's Note for edition 11: in para. 4 of Chapter 19, the\nword \"leafy\" has been changed to \"leaky\". \"leafy\" was the word used",
        "in the printed edition, but was an obvious misprint. Some readers\nhave noted that other editions have slightly different punctuation,\nnotably some extra commas, and semi-colons where there are colons in\nthis edition; but the punctuation herein does follow at least one\nprinted text.--jt]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA DAMSEL IN DISTRESS\n\n\nby Pelham Grenville Wodehouse\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1.\n\nInasmuch as the scene of this story is that historic pile, Belpher\nCastle, in the county of Hampshire, it would be an agreeable task",
        "to open it with a leisurely description of the place, followed by\nsome notes on the history of the Earls of Marshmoreton, who have\nowned it since the fifteenth century. Unfortunately, in these days\nof rush and hurry, a novelist works at a disadvantage. He must\nleap into the middle of his tale with as little delay as he would\nemploy in boarding a moving tramcar. He must get off the mark with\nthe smooth swiftness of a jack-rabbit surprised while lunching.",
        "Otherwise, people throw him aside and go out to picture palaces.\n\nI may briefly remark that the present Lord Marshmoreton is a\nwidower of some forty-eight years: that he has two children--a son,\nPercy Wilbraham Marsh, Lord Belpher, who is on the brink of his\ntwenty-first birthday, and a daughter, Lady Patricia Maud Marsh,\nwho is just twenty: that the chatelaine of the castle is Lady\nCaroline Byng, Lord Marshmoreton's sister, who married the very",
        "wealthy colliery owner, Clifford Byng, a few years before his death\n(which unkind people say she hastened): and that she has a\nstep-son, Reginald. Give me time to mention these few facts and I\nam done. On the glorious past of the Marshmoretons I will not even\ntouch.\n\nLuckily, the loss to literature is not irreparable. Lord\nMarshmoreton himself is engaged upon a history of the family, which\nwill doubtless be on every bookshelf as soon as his lordship gets",
        "it finished. And, as for the castle and its surroundings, including\nthe model dairy and the amber drawing-room, you may see them for\nyourself any Thursday, when Belpher is thrown open to the public on\npayment of a fee of one shilling a head. The money is collected by\nKeggs the butler, and goes to a worthy local charity. At least,\nthat is the idea. But the voice of calumny is never silent, and\nthere exists a school of thought, headed by Albert, the page-boy,",
        "which holds that Keggs sticks to these shillings like glue, and\nadds them to his already considerable savings in the Farmers' and\nMerchants' Bank, on the left side of the High Street in Belpher\nvillage, next door to the Oddfellows' Hall.\n\nWith regard to this, one can only say that Keggs looks far too much\nlike a particularly saintly bishop to indulge in any such practices.\nOn the other hand, Albert knows Keggs. We must leave the matter\nopen.",
        "Of course, appearances are deceptive. Anyone, for instance, who had\nbeen standing outside the front entrance of the castle at eleven\no'clock on a certain June morning might easily have made a mistake.\nSuch a person would probably have jumped to the conclusion that the\nmiddle-aged lady of a determined cast of countenance who was\nstanding near the rose-garden, talking to the gardener and watching\nthe young couple strolling on the terrace below, was the mother of",
        "the pretty girl, and that she was smiling because the latter had\nrecently become engaged to the tall, pleasant-faced youth at her\nside.\n\nSherlock Holmes himself might have been misled. One can hear him\nexplaining the thing to Watson in one of those lightning flashes of\ninductive reasoning of his. \"It is the only explanation, my dear\nWatson. If the lady were merely complimenting the gardener on his\nrose-garden, and if her smile were merely caused by the excellent",
        "appearance of that rose-garden, there would be an answering smile\non the face of the gardener. But, as you see, he looks morose and\ngloomy.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, the gardener--that is to say, the stocky,\nbrown-faced man in shirt sleeves and corduroy trousers who was\nfrowning into a can of whale-oil solution--was the Earl of\nMarshmoreton, and there were two reasons for his gloom. He hated to\nbe interrupted while working, and, furthermore, Lady Caroline Byng",
        "always got on his nerves, and never more so than when, as now, she\nspeculated on the possibility of a romance between her step-son\nReggie and his lordship's daughter Maud.\n\nOnly his intimates would have recognized in this curious\ncorduroy-trousered figure the seventh Earl of Marshmoreton. The\nLord Marshmoreton who made intermittent appearances in London, who\nlunched among bishops at the Athenaeum Club without exciting\nremark, was a correctly dressed gentleman whom no one would have",
        "suspected of covering his sturdy legs in anything but the finest\ncloth. But if you will glance at your copy of Who's Who, and turn\nup the \"M's\", you will find in the space allotted to the Earl the\nwords \"Hobby--Gardening\". To which, in a burst of modest pride, his\nlordship has added \"Awarded first prize for Hybrid Teas, Temple\nFlower Show, 1911\". The words tell their own story.\n\nLord Marshmoreton was the most enthusiastic amateur gardener in a",
        "land of enthusiastic amateur gardeners. He lived for his garden.\nThe love which other men expend on their nearest and dearest Lord\nMarshmoreton lavished on seeds, roses and loamy soil. The hatred\nwhich some of his order feel for Socialists and Demagogues Lord\nMarshmoreton kept for rose slugs, rose-beetles and the small,\nyellowish-white insect which is so depraved and sinister a\ncharacter that it goes through life with an alias--being sometimes",
        "called a rose-hopper and sometimes a thrip. A simple soul, Lord\nMarshmoreton--mild and pleasant. Yet put him among the thrips, and\nhe became a dealer-out of death and slaughter, a destroyer in the\nclass of Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan. Thrips feed on the\nunderside of rose leaves, sucking their juice and causing them to\nturn yellow; and Lord Marshmoreton's views on these things were so\nrigid that he would have poured whale-oil solution on his",
        "grandmother if he had found her on the underside of one of his rose\nleaves sucking its juice.\n\nThe only time in the day when he ceased to be the horny-handed\ntoiler and became the aristocrat was in the evening after dinner,\nwhen, egged on by Lady Caroline, who gave him no rest in the\nmatter--he would retire to his private study and work on his\nHistory of the Family, assisted by his able secretary, Alice\nFaraday. His progress on that massive work was, however, slow. Ten",
        "hours in the open air make a man drowsy, and too often Lord\nMarshmoreton would fall asleep in mid-sentence to the annoyance of\nMiss Faraday, who was a conscientious girl and liked to earn her\nsalary.\n\nThe couple on the terrace had turned. Reggie Byng's face, as he\nbent over Maud, was earnest and animated, and even from a distance\nit was possible to see how the girl's eyes lit up at what he was\nsaying. She was hanging on his words. Lady Caroline's smile became\nmore and more benevolent.",
        "\"They make a charming pair,\" she murmured. \"I wonder what dear\nReggie is saying. Perhaps at this very moment--\"\n\nShe broke off with a sigh of content. She had had her troubles over\nthis affair. Dear Reggie, usually so plastic in her hands, had\ndisplayed an unaccountable reluctance to offer his agreeable self\nto Maud--in spite of the fact that never, not even on the public\nplatform which she adorned so well, had his step-mother reasoned",
        "more clearly than she did when pointing out to him the advantages\nof the match. It was not that Reggie disliked Maud. He admitted\nthat she was a \"topper\", on several occasions going so far as to\ndescribe her as \"absolutely priceless\". But he seemed reluctant to\nask her to marry him. How could Lady Caroline know that Reggie's\nentire world--or such of it as was not occupied by racing cars and\ngolf--was filled by Alice Faraday? Reggie had never told her. He\nhad not even told Miss Faraday.",
        "\"Perhaps at this very moment,\" went on Lady Caroline, \"the dear boy\nis proposing to her.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton grunted, and continued to peer with a questioning\neye in the awesome brew which he had prepared for the thrips.\n\n\"One thing is very satisfactory,\" said Lady Caroline. \"I mean that\nMaud seems entirely to have got over that ridiculous infatuation of\nhers for that man she met in Wales last summer. She could not be so\ncheerful if she were still brooding on that. I hope you will admit",
        "now, John, that I was right in keeping her practically a prisoner\nhere and never allowing her a chance of meeting the man again\neither by accident or design. They say absence makes the heart grow\nfonder. Stuff! A girl of Maud's age falls in and out of love half a\ndozen times a year. I feel sure she has almost forgotten the man by\nnow.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Lord Marshmoreton. His mind had been far away, dealing\nwith green flies.\n\n\"I was speaking about that man Maud met when she was staying with",
        "Brenda in Wales.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" echoed Lady Caroline, annoyed. \"Is that the only comment\nyou can find to make? Your only daughter becomes infatuated with a\nperfect stranger--a man we have never seen--of whom we know nothing,\nnot even his name--nothing except that he is an American and hasn't\na penny--Maud admitted that. And all you say is 'Oh, yes'!\"\n\n\"But it's all over now, isn't it? I understood the dashed affair\nwas all over.\"",
        "\"We hope so. But I should feel safer if Maud were engaged to\nReggie. I do think you might take the trouble to speak to Maud.\"\n\n\"Speak to her? I do speak to her.\" Lord Marshmoreton's brain moved\nslowly when he was pre-occupied with his roses. \"We're on\nexcellent terms.\"\n\nLady Caroline frowned impatiently. Hers was an alert, vigorous\nmind, bright and strong like a steel trap, and her brother's\nvagueness and growing habit of inattention irritated her.",
        "\"I mean to speak to her about becoming engaged to Reggie. You are\nher father. Surely you can at least try to persuade her.\"\n\n\"Can't coerce a girl.\"\n\n\"I never suggested that you should coerce her, as you put it. I\nmerely meant that you could point out to her, as a father, where\nher duty and happiness lie.\"\n\n\"Drink this!\" cried his lordship with sudden fury, spraying his can\nover the nearest bush, and addressing his remark to the invisible",
        "thrips. He had forgotten Lady Caroline completely. \"Don't stint\nyourselves! There's lots more!\"\n\nA girl came down the steps of the castle and made her way towards\nthem. She was a good-looking girl, with an air of quiet efficiency\nabout her. Her eyes were grey and whimsical. Her head was\nuncovered, and the breeze stirred her dark hair. She made a\ngraceful picture in the morning sunshine, and Reggie Byng, sighting\nher from the terrace, wobbled in his tracks, turned pink, and lost",
        "the thread of his remarks.\n\nThe sudden appearance of Alice Faraday always affected him like\nthat.\n\n\"I have copied out the notes you made last night, Lord\nMarshmoreton. I typed two copies.\"\n\nAlice Faraday spoke in a quiet, respectful, yet subtly\nauthoritative voice. She was a girl of great character. Previous\nemployers of her services as secretary had found her a jewel. To\nLord Marshmoreton she was rapidly becoming a perfect incubus. Their",
        "views on the relative importance of gardening and family histories\ndid not coincide. To him the history of the Marshmoreton family was\nthe occupation of the idle hour: she seemed to think that he ought\nto regard it as a life-work. She was always coming and digging him\nout of the garden and dragging him back to what should have been a\npurely after-dinner task. It was Lord Marshmoreton's habit, when\nhe awoke after one of his naps too late to resume work, to throw",
        "out some vague promise of \"attending to it tomorrow\"; but, he\nreflected bitterly, the girl ought to have tact and sense to\nunderstand that this was only polite persiflage, and not to be\ntaken literally.\n\n\"They are very rough,\" continued Alice, addressing her conversation\nto the seat of his lordship's corduroy trousers. Lord Marshmoreton\nalways assumed a stooping attitude when he saw Miss Faraday\napproaching with papers in her hand; for he laboured under a",
        "pathetic delusion, of which no amount of failures could rid him,\nthat if she did not see his face she would withdraw. \"You remember\nlast night you promised you would attend to them this morning.\" She\npaused long enough to receive a non-committal grunt by way of\nanswer. \"Of course, if you're busy--\" she said placidly, with a\nhalf-glance at Lady Caroline. That masterful woman could always be\ncounted on as an ally in these little encounters.",
        "\"Nothing of the kind!\" said Lady Caroline crisply. She was still\nruffled by the lack of attention which her recent utterances had\nreceived, and welcomed the chance of administering discipline. \"Get\nup at once, John, and go in and work.\"\n\n\"I am working,\" pleaded Lord Marshmoreton.\n\nDespite his forty-eight years his sister Caroline still had the\npower at times to make him feel like a small boy. She had been a\ngreat martinet in the days of their mutual nursery.",
        "\"The Family History is more important than grubbing about in the\ndirt. I cannot understand why you do not leave this sort of thing\nto MacPherson. Why you should pay him liberal wages and then do his\nwork for him, I cannot see. You know the publishers are waiting for\nthe History. Go and attend to these notes at once.\"\n\n\"You promised you would attend to them this morning, Lord\nMarshmoreton,\" said Alice invitingly.\n\nLord Marshmoreton clung to his can of whale-oil solution with the",
        "clutch of a drowning man. None knew better than he that these\ninterviews, especially when Caroline was present to lend the weight\nof her dominating personality, always ended in the same way.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" he said. \"Tonight, perhaps. After dinner, eh? Yes,\nafter dinner. That will be capital.\"\n\n\"I think you ought to attend to them this morning,\" said Alice,\ngently persistent. It really perturbed this girl to feel that she\nwas not doing work enough to merit her generous salary. And on the",
        "subject of the history of the Marshmoreton family she was an\nenthusiast. It had a glamour for her.\n\nLord Marshmoreton's fingers relaxed their hold. Throughout the\nrose-garden hundreds of spared thrips went on with their morning\nmeal, unwitting of doom averted.\n\n\"Oh, all right, all right, all right! Come into the library.\"\n\n\"Very well, Lord Marshmoreton.\" Miss Faraday turned to Lady\nCaroline. \"I have been looking up the trains, Lady Caroline. The",
        "best is the twelve-fifteen. It has a dining-car, and stops at\nBelpher if signalled.\"\n\n\"Are you going away, Caroline?\" inquired Lord Marshmoreton\nhopefully.\n\n\"I am giving a short talk to the Social Progress League at\nLewisham. I shall return tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Marshmoreton, hope fading from his voice.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline. \"The twelve-fifteen.\"\n\n\"The motor will be round at a quarter to twelve.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Oh, by the way, Miss Faraday, will you call to Reggie",
        "as you pass, and tell him I wish to speak to him.\"\n\nMaud had left Reggie by the time Alice Faraday reached him, and\nthat ardent youth was sitting on a stone seat, smoking a cigarette\nand entertaining himself with meditations in which thoughts of\nAlice competed for precedence with graver reflections connected\nwith the subject of the correct stance for his approach-shots.\nReggie's was a troubled spirit these days. He was in love, and he",
        "had developed a bad slice with his mid-iron. He was practically a\nsoul in torment.\n\n\"Lady Caroline asked me to tell you that she wishes to speak to\nyou, Mr. Byng.\"\n\nReggie leaped from his seat.\n\n\"Hullo-ullo-ullo! There you are! I mean to say, what?\"\n\nHe was conscious, as was his custom in her presence, of a warm,\nprickly sensation in the small of the back. Some kind of\nelephantiasis seemed to have attacked his hands and feet, swelling",
        "them to enormous proportions. He wished profoundly that he could\nget rid of his habit of yelping with nervous laughter whenever he\nencountered the girl of his dreams. It was calculated to give her a\nwrong impression of a chap--make her think him a fearful chump and\nwhat not!\n\n\"Lady Caroline is leaving by the twelve-fifteen.\"\n\n\"That's good! What I mean to say is--oh, she is, is she? I see\nwhat you mean.\" The absolute necessity of saying something at least",
        "moderately coherent gripped him. He rallied his forces. \"You\nwouldn't care to come for a stroll, after I've seen the mater, or a\nrow on the lake, or any rot like that, would you?\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, but I must go in and help Lord Marshmoreton\nwith his book.\"\n\n\"What a rotten--I mean, what a dam' shame!\"\n\nThe pity of it tore at Reggie's heart strings. He burned with\ngenerous wrath against Lord Marshmoreton, that modern Simon Legree,",
        "who used his capitalistic power to make a slave of this girl and\nkeep her toiling indoors when all the world was sunshine.\n\n\"Shall I go and ask him if you can't put it off till after dinner?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, thanks very much. I'm sure Lord Marshmoreton wouldn't\ndream of it.\"\n\nShe passed on with a pleasant smile. When he had recovered from the\neffect of this Reggie proceeded slowly to the upper level to meet\nhis step-mother.\n\n\"Hullo, mater. Pretty fit and so forth? What did you want to see me\nabout?\"",
        "\"Well, Reggie, what is the news?\"\n\n\"Eh? What? News? Didn't you get hold of a paper at breakfast?\nNothing much in it. Tam Duggan beat Alec Fraser three up and two to\nplay at Prestwick. I didn't notice anything else much. There's a\nnew musical comedy at the Regal. Opened last night, and seems to be\njust like mother makes. The Morning Post gave it a topping notice.\nI must trickle up to town and see it some time this week.\"\n\nLady Caroline frowned. This slowness in the uptake, coming so soon",
        "after her brother's inattention, displeased her.\n\n\"No, no, no. I mean you and Maud have been talking to each other\nfor quite a long time, and she seemed very interested in what you\nwere saying. I hoped you might have some good news for me.\"\n\nReggie's face brightened. He caught her drift.\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes, I see what you mean. No, there wasn't anything of\nthat sort or shape or order.\"\n\n\"What were you saying to her, then, that interested her so much?\"",
        "\"I was explaining how I landed dead on the pin with my spoon out of\na sand-trap at the eleventh hole yesterday. It certainly was a\npretty ripe shot, considering. I'd sliced into this baby bunker,\ndon't you know; I simply can't keep 'em straight with the iron\nnowadays--and there the pill was, grinning up at me from the sand.\nOf course, strictly speaking, I ought to have used a niblick, but--\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say, Reggie, that, with such an excellent",
        "opportunity, you did not ask Maud to marry you?\"\n\n\"I see what you mean. Well, as a matter of absolute fact, I, as it\nwere, didn't.\"\n\nLady Caroline uttered a wordless sound.\n\n\"By the way, mater,\" said Reggie, \"I forgot to tell you about that.\nIt's all off.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Absolutely. You see, it appears there's a chappie unknown for whom\nMaud has an absolute pash. It seems she met this sportsman up in\nWales last summer. She was caught in the rain, and he happened to",
        "be passing and rallied round with his rain-coat, and one thing led\nto another. Always raining in Wales, what! Good fishing, though,\nhere and there. Well, what I mean is, this cove was so deucedly\ncivil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else. He's\nthe blue-eyed boy, and everybody else is an also-ran, with about as\nmuch chance as a blind man with one arm trying to get out of a\nbunker with a tooth-pick.\"\n\n\"What perfect nonsense! I know all about that affair. It was just a",
        "passing fancy that never meant anything. Maud has got over that\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"She didn't seem to think so.\"\n\n\"Now, Reggie,\" said Lady Caroline tensely, \"please listen to me.\nYou know that the castle will be full of people in a day or two for\nPercy's coming-of-age, and this next few days may be your last\nchance of having a real, long, private talk with Maud. I shall be\nseriously annoyed if you neglect this opportunity. There is no\nexcuse for the way you are behaving. Maud is a charming girl--\"",
        "\"Oh, absolutely! One of the best.\"\n\n\"Very well, then!\"\n\n\"But, mater, what I mean to say is--\"\n\n\"I don't want any more temporizing, Reggie!\"\n\n\"No, no! Absolutely not!\" said Reggie dutifully, wishing he knew\nwhat the word meant, and wishing also that life had not become so\nfrightfully complex.\n\n\"Now, this afternoon, why should you not take Maud for a long ride\nin your car?\"\n\nReggie grew more cheerful. At least he had an answer for that.",
        "\"Can't be done, I'm afraid. I've got to motor into town to meet\nPercy. He's arriving from Oxford this morning. I promised to meet\nhim in town and tool him back in the car.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, then, why couldn't you--?\"\n\n\"I say, mater, dear old soul,\" said Reggie hastily, \"I think you'd\nbetter tear yourself away and what not. If you're catching the\ntwelve-fifteen, you ought to be staggering round to see you haven't\nforgotten anything. There's the car coming round now.\"",
        "\"I wish now I had decided to go by a later train.\"\n\n\"No, no, mustn't miss the twelve-fifteen. Good, fruity train.\nEverybody speaks well of it. Well, see you anon, mater. I think\nyou'd better run like a hare.\"\n\n\"You will remember what I said?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, then. I shall be back tomorrow.\"\n\nReggie returned slowly to his stone seat. He breathed a little\nheavily as he felt for his cigarette case. He felt like a hunted\nfawn.",
        "Maud came out of the house as the car disappeared down the long\navenue of elms. She crossed the terrace to where Reggie sat\nbrooding on life and its problem.\n\n\"Reggie!\"\n\nReggie turned.\n\n\"Hullo, Maud, dear old thing. Take a seat.\"\n\nMaud sat down beside him. There was a flush on her pretty face, and\nwhen she spoke her voice quivered with suppressed excitement.\n\n\"Reggie,\" she said, laying a small hand on his arm. \"We're friends,\naren't we?\"",
        "Reggie patted her back paternally. There were few people he liked\nbetter than Maud.\n\n\"Always have been since the dear old days of childhood, what!\"\n\n\"I can trust you, can't I?\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\n\"There's something I want you to do for me, Reggie. You'll have to\nkeep it a dead secret of course.\"\n\n\"The strong, silent man. That's me. What is it?\"\n\n\"You're driving into town in your car this afternoon, aren't you,\nto meet Percy?\"\n\n\"That was the idea.\"\n\n\"Could you go this morning instead--and take me?\"",
        "\"Of course.\"\n\nMaud shook her head.\n\n\"You don't know what you are letting yourself in for, Reggie, or\nI'm sure you wouldn't agree so lightly. I'm not allowed to leave\nthe castle, you know, because of what I was telling you about.\"\n\n\"The chappie?\"\n\n\"Yes. So there would be terrible scenes if anybody found out.\"\n\n\"Never mind, dear old soul. I'll risk it. None shall learn your\nsecret from these lips.\"\n\n\"You're a darling, Reggie.\"\n\n\"But what's the idea? Why do you want to go today particularly?\"",
        "Maud looked over her shoulder.\n\n\"Because--\" She lowered her voice, though there was no one near.\n\"Because he is back in London! He's a sort of secretary, you know,\nReggie, to his uncle, and I saw in the paper this morning that the\nuncle returned yesterday after a long voyage in his yacht. So--he\nmust have come back, too. He has to go everywhere his uncle goes.\"\n\n\"And everywhere the uncle went, the chappie was sure to go!\"\nmurmured Reggie. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.\"",
        "\"I must see him. I haven't seen him since last summer--nearly a\nwhole year! And he hasn't written to me, and I haven't dared to\nwrite to him, for fear of the letter going wrong. So, you see, I\nmust go. Today's my only chance. Aunt Caroline has gone away.\nFather will be busy in the garden, and won't notice whether I'm\nhere or not. And, besides, tomorrow it will be too late, because\nPercy will be here. He was more furious about the thing than\nanyone.\"",
        "\"Rather the proud aristocrat, Percy,\" agreed Reggie. \"I understand\nabsolutely. Tell me just what you want me to do.\"\n\n\"I want you to pick me up in the car about half a mile down the\nroad. You can drop me somewhere in Piccadilly. That will be near\nenough to where I want to go. But the most important thing is about\nPercy. You must persuade him to stay and dine in town and come back\nhere after dinner. Then I shall be able to get back by an afternoon\ntrain, and no one will know I've been gone.\"",
        "\"That's simple enough, what? Consider it done. When do you want to\nstart?\"\n\n\"At once.\"\n\n\"I'll toddle round to the garage and fetch the car.\" Reggie\nchuckled amusedly. \"Rum thing! The mater's just been telling me I\nought to take you for a drive.\"\n\n\"You are a darling, Reggie, really!\"\n\nReggie gave her back another paternal pat.\n\n\"I know what it means to be in love, dear old soul. I say, Maud,\nold thing, do you find love puts you off your stroke? What I mean",
        "is, does it make you slice your approach-shots?\"\n\nMaud laughed.\n\n\"No. It hasn't had any effect on my game so far. I went round in\neighty-six the other day.\"\n\nReggie sighed enviously.\n\n\"Women are wonderful!\" he said. \"Well, I'll be legging it and\nfetching the car. When you're ready, stroll along down the road and\nwait for me.\"\n\n                    *   *   *\n\nWhen he had gone Maud pulled a small newspaper clipping from her\npocket. She had extracted it from yesterday's copy of the Morning",
        "Post's society column. It contained only a few words:\n\n\n    \"Mr. Wilbur Raymond has returned to his residence at\n    No. 11a Belgrave Square from a prolonged voyage in his\n    yacht, the Siren.\"\n\nMaud did not know Mr. Wilbur Raymond, and yet that paragraph had\nsent the blood tingling through every vein in her body. For as she\nhad indicated to Reggie, when the Wilbur Raymonds of this world\nreturn to their town residences, they bring with them their nephew",
        "and secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. And Geoffrey Raymond was the man\nMaud had loved ever since the day when she had met him in Wales.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.\n\nThe sun that had shone so brightly on Belpher Castle at noon, when\nMaud and Reggie Byng set out on their journey, shone on the\nWest-End of London with equal pleasantness at two o'clock. In\nLittle Gooch Street all the children of all the small shopkeepers\nwho support life in that backwater by selling each other vegetables",
        "and singing canaries were out and about playing curious games of\ntheir own invention. Cats washed themselves on doorsteps,\npreparatory to looking in for lunch at one of the numerous garbage\ncans which dotted the sidewalk. Waiters peered austerely from the\nwindows of the two Italian restaurants which carry on the Lucretia\nBorgia tradition by means of one shilling and sixpenny _table d'hôte_\nluncheons. The proprietor of the grocery store on the corner was",
        "bidding a silent farewell to a tomato which even he, though a\ndauntless optimist, had been compelled to recognize as having\noutlived its utility. On all these things the sun shone with a\ngenial smile. Round the corner, in Shaftesbury Avenue, an east wind\nwas doing its best to pierce the hardened hides of the citizenry;\nbut it did not penetrate into Little Gooch Street, which, facing\nsouth and being narrow and sheltered, was enabled practically to\nbask.",
        "Mac, the stout guardian of the stage door of the Regal Theatre,\nwhose gilded front entrance is on the Avenue, emerged from the\nlittle glass case in which the management kept him, and came out to\nobserve life and its phenomena with an indulgent eye. Mac was\nfeeling happy this morning. His job was a permanent one, not\ninfluenced by the success or failure of the productions which\nfollowed one another at the theatre throughout the year; but he",
        "felt, nevertheless, a sort of proprietary interest in these\nventures, and was pleased when they secured the approval of the\npublic. Last night's opening, a musical piece by an American\nauthor and composer, had undoubtedly made a big hit, and Mac was\nglad, because he liked what he had seen of the company, and, in the\nbrief time in which he had known him, had come to entertain a warm\nregard for George Bevan, the composer, who had travelled over from\nNew York to help with the London production.",
        "George Bevan turned the corner now, walking slowly, and, it seemed\nto Mac, gloomily towards the stage door. He was a young man of\nabout twenty-seven, tall and well knit, with an agreeable,\nclean-cut face, of which a pair of good and honest eyes were the\nmost noticeable feature. His sensitive mouth was drawn down a\nlittle at the corners, and he looked tired.\n\n\"Morning, Mac.\"\n\n\"Good morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Anything for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Some telegrams. I'll get 'em. Oh, I'll _get_ 'em,\" said",
        "Mac, as if reassuring some doubting friend and supporter as to his\nability to carry through a labour of Hercules.\n\nHe disappeared into his glass case. George Bevan remained outside\nin the street surveying the frisking children with a sombre glance.\nThey seemed to him very noisy, very dirty and very young.\nDisgustingly young. Theirs was joyous, exuberant youth which made a\nfellow feel at least sixty. Something was wrong with George today,",
        "for normally he was fond of children. Indeed, normally he was fond\nof most things. He was a good-natured and cheerful young man, who\nliked life and the great majority of those who lived it\ncontemporaneously with himself. He had no enemies and many\nfriends.\n\nBut today he had noticed from the moment he had got out of bed that\nsomething was amiss with the world. Either he was in the grip of\nsome divine discontent due to the highly developed condition of his",
        "soul, or else he had a grouch. One of the two. Or it might have\nbeen the reaction from the emotions of the previous night. On the\nmorning after an opening your sensitive artist is always apt to\nfeel as if he had been dried over a barrel.\n\nBesides, last night there had been a supper party after the\nperformance at the flat which the comedian of the troupe had rented\nin Jermyn Street, a forced, rowdy supper party where a number of\ntired people with over-strained nerves had seemed to feel it a duty",
        "to be artificially vivacious. It had lasted till four o'clock when\nthe morning papers with the notices arrived, and George had not got\nto bed till four-thirty. These things colour the mental outlook.\n\nMac reappeared.\n\n\"Here you are, sir.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nGeorge put the telegrams in his pocket. A cat, on its way back from\nlunch, paused beside him in order to use his leg as a serviette.\nGeorge tickled it under the ear abstractedly. He was always",
        "courteous to cats, but today he went through the movements\nperfunctorily and without enthusiasm.\n\nThe cat moved on. Mac became conversational.\n\n\"They tell me the piece was a hit last night, sir.\"\n\n\"It seemed to go very well.\"\n\n\"My Missus saw it from the gallery, and all the first-nighters was\nspeaking very 'ighly of it. There's a regular click, you know, sir,\nover here in London, that goes to all the first nights in the\ngallery. 'Ighly critical they are always. Specially if it's an",
        "American piece like this one. If they don't like it, they precious\nsoon let you know. My missus ses they was all speakin' very 'ighly\nof it. My missus says she ain't seen a livelier show for a long\ntime, and she's a great theatregoer. My missus says they was all\nspecially pleased with the music.\"\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\n\"The Morning Leader give it a fine write-up. How was the rest of\nthe papers?\"\n\n\"Splendid, all of them. I haven't seen the evening papers yet. I\ncame out to get them.\"",
        "Mac looked down the street.\n\n\"There'll be a rehearsal this afternoon, I suppose, sir? Here's\nMiss Dore coming along.\"\n\nGeorge followed his glance. A tall girl in a tailor-made suit of\nblue was coming towards them. Even at a distance one caught the\ngenial personality of the new arrival. It seemed to go before her\nlike a heartening breeze. She picked her way carefully through the\nchildren crawling on the side walk. She stopped for a moment and",
        "said something to one of them. The child grinned. Even the\nproprietor of the grocery store appeared to brighten up at the\nsight of her, as at the sight of some old friend.\n\n\"How's business, Bill?\" she called to him as she passed the spot\nwhere he stood brooding on the mortality of tomatoes. And, though\nhe replied \"Rotten\", a faint, grim smile did nevertheless flicker\nacross his tragic mask.\n\nBillie Dore, who was one of the chorus of George Bevan's musical",
        "comedy, had an attractive face, a mouth that laughed readily,\nrather bright golden hair (which, she was fond of insisting with\nperfect truth, was genuine though appearances were against it), and\nsteady blue eyes. The latter were frequently employed by her in\nquelling admirers who were encouraged by the former to become too\nardent. Billie's views on the opposite sex who forgot themselves\nwere as rigid as those of Lord Marshmoreton concerning thrips. She",
        "liked men, and she would signify this liking in a practical manner\nby lunching and dining with them, but she was entirely\nself-supporting, and when men overlooked that fact she reminded\nthem of it in no uncertain voice; for she was a girl of ready speech\nand direct.\n\n\"'Morning, George. 'Morning, Mac. Any mail?\"\n\n\"I'll see, miss.\"\n\n\"How did your better four-fifths like the show, Mac?\"\n\n\"I was just telling Mr. Bevan, miss, that the missus said she\n'adn't seen a livelier show for a long time.\"",
        "\"Fine. I knew I'd be a hit. Well, George, how's the boy this bright\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Limp and pessimistic.\"\n\n\"That comes of sitting up till four in the morning with festive\nhams.\"\n\n\"You were up as late as I was, and you look like Little Eva after a\nnight of sweet, childish slumber.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I drank ginger ale, and didn't smoke eighteen cigars. And\nyet, I don't know. I think I must be getting old, George. All-night\nparties seem to have lost their charm. I was ready to quit at one",
        "o'clock, but it didn't seem matey. I think I'll marry a farmer and\nsettle down.\"\n\nGeorge was amazed. He had not expected to find his present view of\nlife shared in this quarter.\n\n\"I was just thinking myself,\" he said, feeling not for the first\ntime how different Billie was from the majority of those with whom\nhis profession brought him in contact, \"how flat it all was. The\nshow business I mean, and these darned first nights, and the party",
        "after the show which you can't sidestep. Something tells me I'm\nabout through.\"\n\nBillie Dore nodded.\n\n\"Anybody with any sense is always about through with the show\nbusiness. I know I am. If you think I'm wedded to my art, let me\ntell you I'm going to get a divorce the first chance that comes\nalong. It's funny about the show business. The way one drifts into\nit and sticks, I mean. Take me, for example. Nature had it all\ndoped out for me to be the Belle of Hicks Corners. What I ought to",
        "have done was to buy a gingham bonnet and milk cows. But I would\ncome to the great city and help brighten up the tired business\nman.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you were fond of the country, Billie.\"\n\n\"Me? I wrote the words and music. Didn't you know I was a country\nkid? My dad ran a Bide a Wee Home for flowers, and I used to know\nthem all by their middle names. He was a nursery gardener out in\nIndiana. I tell you, when I see a rose nowadays, I shake its hand",
        "and say: 'Well, well, Cyril, how's everything with you? And how are\nJoe and Jack and Jimmy and all the rest of the boys at home?' Do\nyou know how I used to put in my time the first few nights I was\nover here in London? I used to hang around Covent Garden with my\nhead back, sniffing. The boys that mess about with the flowers\nthere used to stub their toes on me so often that they got to look\non me as part of the scenery.\"\n\n\"That's where we ought to have been last night.\"",
        "\"We'd have had a better time. Say, George, did you see the awful\nmistake on Nature's part that Babe Sinclair showed up with towards\nthe middle of the proceedings? You must have noticed him, because\nhe took up more room than any one man was entitled to. His name was\nSpenser Gray.\"\n\nGeorge recalled having been introduced to a fat man of his own age\nwho answered to that name.\n\n\"It's a darned shame,\" said Billie indignantly. \"Babe is only a",
        "kid. This is the first show she's been in. And I happen to know\nthere's an awfully nice boy over in New York crazy to marry her.\nAnd I'm certain this gink is giving her a raw deal. He tried to\nget hold of me about a week ago, but I turned him down hard; and I\nsuppose he thinks Babe is easier. And it's no good talking to her;\nshe thinks he's wonderful. That's another kick I have against the\nshow business. It seems to make girls such darned chumps. Well, I",
        "wonder how much longer Mr. Arbuckle is going to be retrieving my\nmail. What ho, within there, Fatty!\"\n\nMac came out, apologetic, carrying letters.\n\n\"Sorry, miss. By an oversight I put you among the G's.\"\n\n\"All's well that ends well. 'Put me among the G's.' There's a good\ntitle for a song for you, George. Excuse me while I grapple with\nthe correspondence. I'll bet half of these are mash notes. I got\nthree between the first and second acts last night. Why the",
        "nobility and gentry of this burg should think that I'm their\naffinity just because I've got golden hair--which is perfectly\ngenuine, Mac; I can show you the pedigree--and because I earn an\nhonest living singing off the key, is more than I can understand.\"\n\nMac leaned his massive shoulders comfortably against the building,\nand resumed his chat.\n\n\"I expect you're feeling very 'appy today, sir?\"\n\nGeorge pondered. He was certainly feeling better since he had seen",
        "Billie Dore, but he was far from being himself.\n\n\"I ought to be, I suppose. But I'm not.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're getting blarzy, sir, that's what it is. You've 'ad too\nmuch of the fat, you 'ave. This piece was a big 'it in America,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. It ran over a year in New York, and there are three companies\nof it out now.\"\n\n\"That's 'ow it is, you see. You've gone and got blarzy. Too big a\n'elping of success, you've 'ad.\" Mac wagged a head like a harvest\nmoon. \"You aren't a married man, are you, sir?\"",
        "Billie Dore finished skimming through her mail, and crumpled the\nletters up into a large ball, which she handed to Mac.\n\n\"Here's something for you to read in your spare moments, Mac.\nGlance through them any time you have a suspicion you may be a\nchump, and you'll have the comfort of knowing that there are\nothers. What were you saying about being married?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bevan and I was 'aving a talk about 'im being blarzy, miss.\"\n\n\"Are you blarzy, George?\"\n\n\"So Mac says.\"",
        "\"And why is he blarzy, miss?\" demanded Mac rhetorically.\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Billie. \"It's not my fault.\"\n\n\"It's because, as I was saying, 'e's 'ad too big a 'elping of\nsuccess, and because 'e ain't a married man.

Comes of bein' a artist, I suppose.\"",
        "Miss Dore dived into her vanity case and produced a puff with which\nshe proceeded to powder her nose.\n\n\"All composers are nuts, Mac. I was in a show once where the\nmanager was panning the composer because there wasn't a number in\nthe score that had a tune to it. The poor geek admitted they\nweren't very tuney, but said the thing about his music was that it\nhad such a wonderful aroma. They all get that way. The jazz seems\nto go to their heads. George is all right, though, and don't let",
        "anyone tell you different.\"\n\n\"Have you know him long, miss?\"\n\n\"About five years. I was a stenographer in the house that published\nhis songs when I first met him. And there's another thing you've\ngot to hand it to George for. He hasn't let success give him a\nswelled head. The money that boy makes is sinful, Mac. He wears\nthousand dollar bills next to his skin winter and summer. But he's\njust the same as he was when I first knew him, when he was just",
        "hanging around Broadway, looking out for a chance to be allowed to\nslip a couple of interpolated numbers into any old show that came\nalong. Yes. Put it in your diary, Mac, and write it on your cuff,\nGeorge Bevan's all right. He's an ace.\"\n\nUnconscious of these eulogies, which, coming from one whose\njudgment he respected, might have cheered him up, George wandered\ndown Shaftesbury Avenue feeling more depressed than ever. The sun\nhad gone in for the time being, and the east wind was frolicking",
        "round him like a playful puppy, patting him with a cold paw,\nnuzzling his ankles, bounding away and bounding back again, and\nbehaving generally as east winds do when they discover a victim who\nhas come out without his spring overcoat. It was plain to George\nnow that the sun and the wind were a couple of confidence\ntricksters working together as a team. The sun had disarmed him\nwith specious promises and an air of cheery goodfellowship, and had",
        "delivered him into the hands of the wind, which was now going\nthrough him with the swift thoroughness of the professional hold-up\nartist. He quickened his steps, and began to wonder if he was so\nsunk in senile decay as to have acquired a liver.\n\nHe discarded the theory as repellent. And yet there must be a\nreason for his depression. Today of all days, as Mac had pointed\nout, he had everything to make him happy. Popular as he was in",
        "America, this was the first piece of his to be produced in London,\nand there was no doubt that it was a success of unusual dimensions.\nAnd yet he felt no elation.\n\nHe reached Piccadilly and turned westwards. And then, as he passed\nthe gates of the In and Out Club, he had a moment of clear vision\nand understood everything. He was depressed because he was bored,\nand he was bored because he was lonely. Mac, that solid thinker,\nhad been right. The solution of the problem of life was to get hold",
        "of the right girl and have a home to go back to at night. He was\nmildly surprised that he had tried in any other direction for an\nexplanation of his gloom. It was all the more inexplicable in that\nfully 80 per cent of the lyrics which he had set in the course of\nhis musical comedy career had had that thought at the back of them.\n\nGeorge gave himself up to an orgy of sentimentality. He seemed to\nbe alone in the world which had paired itself off into a sort of",
        "seething welter of happy couples. Taxicabs full of happy couples\nrolled by every minute. Passing omnibuses creaked beneath the\nweight of happy couples. The very policeman across the Street had\njust grinned at a flitting shop girl, and she had smiled back at\nhim. The only female in London who did not appear to be attached\nwas a girl in brown who was coming along the sidewalk at a\nleisurely pace, looking about her in a manner that suggested that",
        "she found Piccadilly a new and stimulating spectacle.\n\nAs far as George could see she was an extremely pretty girl, small\nand dainty, with a proud little tilt to her head and the jaunty\nwalk that spoke of perfect health. She was, in fact, precisely the\nsort of girl that George felt he could love with all the stored-up\ndevotion of an old buffer of twenty-seven who had squandered none\nof his rich nature in foolish flirtations. He had just begun to",
        "weave a rose-tinted romance about their two selves, when a cold\nreaction set in. Even as he paused to watch the girl threading her\nway through the crowd, the east wind jabbed an icy finger down the\nback of his neck, and the chill of it sobered him. After all, he\nreflected bitterly, this girl was only alone because she was on her\nway somewhere to meet some confounded man. Besides there was no\nearthly chance of getting to know her. You can't rush up to pretty",
        "girls in the street and tell them you are lonely. At least, you\ncan, but it doesn't get you anywhere except the police station.\nGeorge's gloom deepened--a thing he would not have believed\npossible a moment before. He felt that he had been born too late.\nThe restraints of modern civilization irked him. It was not, he\ntold himself, like this in the good old days.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, for example, this girl would have been a\nDamsel; and in that happy time practically everybody whose",
        "technical rating was that of Damsel was in distress and only too\nwilling to waive the formalities in return for services rendered by\nthe casual passer-by. But the twentieth century is a prosaic age,\nwhen girls are merely girls and have no troubles at all. Were he\nto stop this girl in brown and assure her that his aid and comfort\nwere at her disposal, she would undoubtedly call that large\npoliceman from across the way, and the romance would begin and end",
        "within the space of thirty seconds, or, if the policeman were a\nquick mover, rather less.\n\nBetter to dismiss dreams and return to the practical side of life\nby buying the evening papers from the shabby individual beside him,\nwho had just thrust an early edition in his face. After all notices\nare notices, even when the heart is aching. George felt in his\npocket for the necessary money, found emptiness, and remembered\nthat he had left all his ready funds at his hotel. It was just one",
        "of the things he might have expected on a day like this.\n\nThe man with the papers had the air of one whose business is\nconducted on purely cash principles. There was only one thing to be\ndone, return to the hotel, retrieve his money, and try to forget\nthe weight of the world and its cares in lunch. And from the hotel\nhe could despatch the two or three cables which he wanted to send\nto New York.\n\nThe girl in brown was quite close now, and George was enabled to",
        "get a clearer glimpse of her. She more than fulfilled the promise\nshe had given at a distance. Had she been constructed to his own\nspecifications, she would not have been more acceptable in George's\nsight. And now she was going out of his life for ever. With an\noverwhelming sense of pathos, for there is no pathos more bitter\nthan that of parting from someone we have never met, George hailed\na taxicab which crawled at the side of the road; and, with all the",
        "refrains of all the sentimental song hits he had ever composed\nringing in his ears, he got in and passed away.\n\n\"A rotten world,\" he mused, as the cab, after proceeding a couple\nof yards, came to a standstill in a block of the traffic. \"A dull,\nflat bore of a world, in which nothing happens or ever will happen.\nEven when you take a cab it just sticks and doesn't move.\"\n\nAt this point the door of the cab opened, and the girl in brown\njumped in.",
        "\"I'm so sorry,\" she said breathlessly, \"but would you mind hiding\nme, please.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.\n\nGeorge hid her. He did it, too, without wasting precious time by\nasking questions. In a situation which might well have thrown the\nquickest-witted of men off his balance, he acted with promptitude,\nintelligence and despatch. The fact is, George had for years been\nan assiduous golfer; and there is no finer school for teaching\nconcentration and a strict attention to the matter in hand. Few",
        "crises, however unexpected, have the power to disturb a man who has\nso conquered the weakness of the flesh as to have trained himself\nto bend his left knee, raise his left heel, swing his arms well out\nfrom the body, twist himself into the shape of a corkscrew and use\nthe muscle of the wrist, at the same time keeping his head still\nand his eye on the ball. It is estimated that there are\ntwenty-three important points to be borne in mind simultaneously",
        "while making a drive at golf; and to the man who has mastered the\nart of remembering them all the task of hiding girls in taxicabs is\nmere child's play. To pull down the blinds on the side of the\nvehicle nearest the kerb was with George the work of a moment. Then\nhe leaned out of the centre window in such a manner as completely\nto screen the interior of the cab from public view.\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" murmured a voice behind him. It seemed to come\nfrom the floor.",
        "\"Not at all,\" said George, trying a sort of vocal chip-shot out of\nthe corner of his mouth, designed to lift his voice backwards and\nlay it dead inside the cab.\n\nHe gazed upon Piccadilly with eyes from which the scales had\nfallen. Reason told him that he was still in Piccadilly. Otherwise\nit would have seemed incredible to him that this could be the same\nstreet which a moment before he had passed judgment upon and found\nflat and uninteresting. True, in its salient features it had",
        "altered little. The same number of stodgy-looking people moved up\nand down. The buildings retained their air of not having had a bath\nsince the days of the Tudors. The east wind still blew. But,\nthough superficially the same, in reality Piccadilly had altered\ncompletely. Before it had been just Piccadilly. Now it was a golden\nstreet in the City of Romance, a main thoroughfare of Bagdad, one\nof the principal arteries of the capital of Fairyland. A",
        "rose-coloured mist swam before George's eyes. His spirits, so low\nbut a few moments back, soared like a good niblick shot out of the\nbunker of Gloom. The years fell away from him till, in an instant,\nfrom being a rather poorly preserved, liverish greybeard of\nsixty-five or so, he became a sprightly lad of twenty-one in a\nworld of springtime and flowers and laughing brooks. In other\nwords, taking it by and large, George felt pretty good. The",
        "impossible had happened; Heaven had sent him an adventure, and he\ndidn't care if it snowed.\n\nIt was possibly the rose-coloured mist before his eyes that\nprevented him from observing the hurried approach of a faultlessly\nattired young man, aged about twenty-one, who during George's\npreparations for ensuring privacy in his cab had been galloping in\npursuit in a resolute manner that suggested a well-dressed\nbloodhound somewhat overfed and out of condition. Only when this",
        "person stopped and began to pant within a few inches of his face\ndid he become aware of his existence.\n\n\"You, sir!\" said the bloodhound, removing a gleaming silk hat,\nmopping a pink forehead, and replacing the luminous superstructure\nonce more in position. \"You, sir!\"\n\nWhatever may be said of the possibility of love at first sight, in\nwhich theory George was now a confirmed believer, there can be no\ndoubt that an exactly opposite phenomenon is of frequent",
        "occurrence. After one look at some people even friendship is\nimpossible. Such a one, in George's opinion, was this gurgling\nexcrescence underneath the silk hat. He comprised in his single\nperson practically all the qualities which George disliked most. He\nwas, for a young man, extraordinarily obese. Already a second\nedition of his chin had been published, and the perfectly-cut\nmorning coat which encased his upper section bulged out in an",
        "opulent semi-circle. He wore a little moustache, which to George's\nprejudiced eye seemed more a complaint than a moustache. His face\nwas red, his manner dictatorial, and he was touched in the wind.\nTake him for all in all he looked like a bit of bad news.\n\nGeorge had been educated at Lawrenceville and Harvard, and had\nsubsequently had the privilege of mixing socially with many of New\nYork's most prominent theatrical managers; so he knew how to behave",
        "himself. No Vere de Vere could have exhibited greater repose of\nmanner.\n\n\"And what,\" he inquired suavely, leaning a little further out of\nthe cab, \"is eating you, Bill?\"\n\nA messenger boy, two shabby men engaged in non-essential\nindustries, and a shop girl paused to observe the scene. Time was\nnot of the essence to these confirmed sightseers. The shop girl was\nlate already, so it didn't matter if she was any later; the\nmessenger boy had nothing on hand except a message marked",
        "\"Important: Rush\"; and as for the two shabby men, their only\nimmediate plans consisted of a vague intention of getting to some\npublic house and leaning against the wall; so George's time was\ntheir time. One of the pair put his head on one side and said:\n\"What ho!\"; the other picked up a cigar stub from the gutter and\nbegan to smoke.\n\n\"A young lady just got into your cab,\" said the stout young man.\n\n\"Surely not?\" said George.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean--surely not?\"",
        "\"I've been in the cab all the time, and I should have noticed it.\"\n\nAt this juncture the block in the traffic was relieved, and the cab\nbowled smartly on for some fifty yards when it was again halted.\nGeorge, protruding from the window like a snail, was entertained by\nthe spectacle of the pursuit. The hunt was up. Short of throwing\nhis head up and baying, the stout young man behaved exactly as a\nbloodhound in similar circumstances would have conducted itself. He",
        "broke into a jerky gallop, attended by his self-appointed\nassociates; and, considering that the young man was so stout, that\nthe messenger boy considered it unprofessional to hurry, that the\nshop girl had doubts as to whether sprinting was quite ladylike,\nand that the two Bohemians were moving at a quicker gait than a\nshuffle for the first occasion in eleven years, the cavalcade made\ngood time. The cab was still stationary when they arrived in a\nbody.",
        "\"Here he is, guv'nor,\" said the messenger boy, removing a bead of\nperspiration with the rush message.\n\n\"Here he is, guv'nor,\" said the non-smoking Bohemian. \"What oh!\"\n\n\"Here I am!\" agreed George affably. \"And what can I do for you?\"\n\nThe smoker spat appreciatively at a passing dog. The point seemed\nto him well taken. Not for many a day had he so enjoyed himself. In\nan arid world containing too few goes of gin and too many\npolicemen, a world in which the poor were oppressed and could",
        "seldom even enjoy a quiet cigar without having their fingers\ntrodden upon, he found himself for the moment contented, happy, and\nexpectant. This looked like a row between toffs, and of all things\nwhich most intrigued him a row between toffs ranked highest.\n\n\"R!\" he said approvingly. \"Now you're torkin'!\"\n\nThe shop girl had espied an acquaintance in the crowd. She gave\ntongue.\n\n\"Mordee! Cummere! Cummere quick! Sumfin' hap'nin'!\" Maudie,",
        "accompanied by perhaps a dozen more of London's millions, added\nherself to the audience. These all belonged to the class which will\ngather round and watch silently while a motorist mends a tyre. They\nare not impatient. They do not call for rapid and continuous\naction. A mere hole in the ground, which of all sights is perhaps\nthe least vivid and dramatic, is enough to grip their attention for\nhours at a time. They stared at George and George's cab with",
        "unblinking gaze. They did not know what would happen or when it\nwould happen, but they intended to wait till something did happen.\nIt might be for years or it might be for ever, but they meant to be\nthere when things began to occur.\n\nSpeculations became audible.\n\n\"Wot is it? 'Naccident?\"\n\n\"Nah! Gent 'ad 'is pocket picked!\"\n\n\"Two toffs 'ad a scrap!\"\n\n\"Feller bilked the cabman!\"\n\nA sceptic made a cynical suggestion.\n\n\"They're doin' of it for the pictures.\"\n\nThe idea gained instant popularity.",
        "\"Jear that? It's a fillum!\"\n\n\"Wot o', Charlie!\"\n\n\"The kemerer's 'idden in the keb.\"\n\n\"Wot'll they be up to next!\"\n\nA red-nosed spectator with a tray of collar-studs harnessed to his\nstomach started another school of thought. He spoke with decision\nas one having authority.\n\n\"Nothin' of the blinkin' kind! The fat 'un's bin 'avin' one or two\naround the corner, and it's gorn and got into 'is 'ead!\"\n\nThe driver of the cab, who till now had been ostentatiously unaware",
        "that there was any sort of disturbance among the lower orders,\nsuddenly became humanly inquisitive.\n\n\"What's it all about?\" he asked, swinging around and addressing\nGeorge's head.\n\n\"Exactly what I want to know,\" said George. He indicated the\ncollar-stud merchant. \"The gentleman over there with the portable\nWoolworth-bargain-counter seems to me to have the best theory.\"\n\nThe stout young man, whose peculiar behaviour had drawn all this\nflattering attention from the many-headed and who appeared",
        "considerably ruffled by the publicity, had been puffing noisily\nduring the foregoing conversation. Now, having recovered sufficient\nbreath to resume the attack, he addressed himself to George once\nmore.\n\n\"Damn you, sir, will you let me look inside that cab?\"\n\n\"Leave me,\" said George, \"I would be alone.\"\n\n\"There is a young lady in that cab. I saw her get in, and I have\nbeen watching ever since, and she has not got out, so she is there\nnow.\"\n\nGeorge nodded approval of this close reasoning.",
        "\"Your argument seems to be without a flaw. But what then? We\napplaud the Man of Logic, but what of the Man of Action? What are\nyou going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Get out of my way!\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"Then I'll force my way in!\"\n\n\"If you try it, I shall infallibly bust you one on the jaw.\"\n\nThe stout young man drew back a pace.\n\n\"You can't do that sort of thing, you know.\"\n\n\"I know I can't,\" said George, \"but I shall. In this life, my dear\nsir, we must be prepared for every emergency. We must distinguish",
        "between the unusual and the impossible. It would be unusual for a\ncomparative stranger to lean out of a cab window and sock you one,\nbut you appear to have laid your plans on the assumption that it\nwould be impossible. Let this be a lesson to you!\"\n\n\"I tell you what it is--\"\n\n\"The advice I give to every young man starting life is 'Never\nconfuse the unusual with the impossible!' Take the present case,\nfor instance. If you had only realized the possibility of somebody",
        "some day busting you on the jaw when you tried to get into a cab,\nyou might have thought out dozens of crafty schemes for dealing\nwith the matter. As it is, you are unprepared. The thing comes on\nyou as a surprise. The whisper flies around the clubs: 'Poor old\nWhat's-his-name has been taken unawares. He cannot cope with the\nsituation!'\"\n\nThe man with the collar-studs made another diagnosis. He was seeing\nclearer and clearer into the thing every minute.",
        "\"Looney!\" he decided. \"This 'ere one's bin moppin' of it up, and\nthe one in the keb's orf 'is bloomin' onion. That's why 'e 's\nstandin' up instead of settin'. 'E won't set down 'cept you bring\n'im a bit o' toast, 'cos he thinks 'e 's a poached egg.\"\n\nGeorge beamed upon the intelligent fellow.\n\n\"Your reasoning is admirable, but--\"\n\nHe broke off here, not because he had not more to say, but for the\nreason that the stout young man, now in quite a Berserk frame of",
        "mind, made a sudden spring at the cab door and clutched the handle,\nwhich he was about to wrench when George acted with all the\npromptitude and decision which had marked his behaviour from the\nstart.\n\nIt was a situation which called for the nicest judgment. To allow\nthe assailant free play with the handle or even to wrestle with him\nfor its possession entailed the risk that the door might open and\nreveal the girl. To bust the young man on the jaw, as promised, on",
        "the other hand, was not in George's eyes a practical policy.\nExcellent a deterrent as the threat of such a proceeding might be,\nits actual accomplishment was not to be thought of. Gaols yawn and\nactions for assault lie in wait for those who go about the place\nbusting their fellows on the jaw. No. Something swift, something\ndecided and immediate was indicated, but something that stopped\nshort of technical battery.\n\nGeorge brought his hand round with a sweep and knocked the stout",
        "young man's silk hat off.\n\nThe effect was magical. We all of us have our Achilles heel,\nand--paradoxically enough--in the case of the stout young man that\nheel was his hat. Superbly built by the only hatter in London who\ncan construct a silk hat that is a silk hat, and freshly ironed by\nloving hands but a brief hour before at the only shaving-parlour in\nLondon where ironing is ironing and not a brutal attack, it was his\npride and joy. To lose it was like losing his trousers. It made him",
        "feel insufficiently clad. With a passionate cry like that of some\nwild creature deprived of its young, the erstwhile Berserk released\nthe handle and sprang in pursuit. At the same moment the traffic\nmoved on again.\n\nThe last George saw was a group scene with the stout young man in\nthe middle of it. The hat had been popped up into the infield,\nwhere it had been caught by the messenger boy. The stout young man\nwas bending over it and stroking it with soothing fingers. It was",
        "too far off for anything to be audible, but he seemed to George to\nbe murmuring words of endearment to it. Then, placing it on his\nhead, he darted out into the road and George saw him no more. The\naudience remained motionless, staring at the spot where the\nincident had happened. They would continue to do this till the next\npoliceman came along and moved them on.\n\nWith a pleasant wave of farewell, in case any of them might be\nglancing in his direction, George drew in his body and sat down.",
        "The girl in brown had risen from the floor, if she had ever been\nthere, and was now seated composedly at the further end of the cab.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.\n\n\"Well, that's that!\" said George.\n\n\"I'm so much obliged,\" said the girl.\n\n\"It was a pleasure,\" said George.\n\nHe was enabled now to get a closer, more leisurely and much more\nsatisfactory view of this distressed damsel than had been his good\nfortune up to the present. Small details which, when he had first",
        "caught sight of her, distance had hidden from his view, now\npresented themselves. Her eyes, he discovered, which he had\nsupposed brown, were only brown in their general colour-scheme.\nThey were shot with attractive little flecks of gold, matching\nperfectly the little streaks of gold which the sun, coming out again\non one of his flying visits and now shining benignantly once more on\nthe world, revealed in her hair. Her chin was square and",
        "determined, but its resoluteness was contradicted by a dimple and\nby the pleasant good-humour of the mouth; and a further softening\nof the face was effected by the nose, which seemed to have started\nout with the intention of being dignified and aristocratic but had\ndefeated its purpose by tilting very slightly at the tip. This was\na girl who would take chances, but would take them with a smile and\nlaugh when she lost.\n\nGeorge was but an amateur physiognomist, but he could read what was",
        "obvious in the faces he encountered; and the more he looked at this\ngirl, the less he was able to understand the scene which had just\noccurred. The thing mystified him completely. For all her\ngood-humour, there was an air, a manner, a something capable and\ndefensive, about this girl with which he could not imagine any man\nventuring to take liberties. The gold-brown eyes, as they met his\nnow, were friendly and smiling, but he could imagine them freezing",
        "into a stare baleful enough and haughty enough to quell such a\nperson as the silk-hatted young man with a single glance. Why,\nthen, had that super-fatted individual been able to demoralize her\nto the extent of flying to the shelter of strange cabs? She was\ncomposed enough now, it was true, but it had been quite plain that\nat the moment when she entered the taxi her nerve had momentarily\nforsaken her. There were mysteries here, beyond George.",
        "The girl looked steadily at George and George looked steadily at\nher for the space of perhaps ten seconds. She seemed to George to\nbe summing him up, weighing him. That the inspection proved\nsatisfactory was shown by the fact that at the end of this period\nshe smiled. Then she laughed, a clear pealing laugh which to George\nwas far more musical than the most popular song-hit he had ever\nwritten.\n\n\"I suppose you are wondering what it's all about?\" she said.",
        "This was precisely what George was wondering most consumedly.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said. \"Not at all. It's not my business.\"\n\n\"And of course you're much too well bred to be inquisitive about\nother people's business?\"\n\n\"Of course I am. What was it all about?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't tell you.\"\n\n\"But what am I to say to the cabman?\"\n\n\"I don't know. What do men usually say to cabmen?\"\n\n\"I mean he will feel very hurt if I don't give him a full\nexplanation of all this. He stooped from his pedestal to make",
        "enquiries just now. Condescension like that deserves some\nrecognition.\"\n\n\"Give him a nice big tip.\"\n\nGeorge was reminded of his reason for being in the cab.\n\n\"I ought to have asked before,\" he said. \"Where can I drive you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I mustn't steal your cab. Where were you going?\"\n\n\"I was going back to my hotel. I came out without any money, so I\nshall have to go there first to get some.\"\n\nThe girl started.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked George.\n\n\"I've lost my purse!\"\n\n\"Good Lord! Had it much in it?\"",
        "\"Not very much. But enough to buy a ticket home.\"\n\n\"Any use asking where that is?\"\n\n\"None, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course not. That's what I admire so much in you. You aren't\ninquisitive.\"\n\nGeorge reflected.\n\n\"There's only one thing to be done. You will have to wait in the\ncab at the hotel, while I go and get some money. Then, if you'll\nlet me, I can lend you what you require.\"\n\n\"It's much too kind of you. Could you manage eleven shillings?\"",
        "\"Easily. I've just had a legacy.\"\n\n\"Of course, if you think I ought to be economical, I'll go\nthird-class. That would only be five shillings. Ten-and-six is the\nfirst-class fare. So you see the place I want to get to is two\nhours from London.\"\n\n\"Well, that's something to know.\"\n\n\"But not much, is it?\"\n\n\"I think I had better lend you a sovereign. Then you'll be able to\nbuy a lunch-basket.\"\n\n\"You think of everything. And you're perfectly right. I shall be",
        "starving. But how do you know you will get the money back?\"\n\n\"I'll risk it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I shall have to be inquisitive and ask your name.\nOtherwise I shan't know where to send the money.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no mystery about me. I'm an open book.\"\n\n\"You needn't be horrid about it. I can't help being mysterious.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"It sounded as if you did. Well, who is my benefactor?\"\n\n\"My name is George Bevan. I am staying at the Carlton at present.\"\n\n\"I'll remember.\"",
        "The taxi moved slowly down the Haymarket. The girl laughed.\n\n\"Yes?\" said George.\n\n\"I was only thinking of back there. You know, I haven't thanked you\nnearly enough for all you did. You were wonderful.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad I was able to be of any help.\"\n\n\"What did happen? You must remember I couldn't see a thing except\nyour back, and I could only hear indistinctly.\"\n\n\"Well, it started by a man galloping up and insisting that you had\ngot into the cab. He was a fellow with the appearance of a",
        "before-using advertisement of an anti-fat medicine and the manners\nof a ring-tailed chimpanzee.\"\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\n\"Then it was Percy! I knew I wasn't mistaken.\"\n\n\"Percy?\"\n\n\"That is his name.\"\n\n\"It would be! I could have betted on it.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"I reasoned with the man, but didn't seem to soothe him, and\nfinally he made a grab for the door-handle, so I knocked off his\nhat, and while he was retrieving it we moved on and escaped.\"\n\nThe girl gave another silver peal of laughter.",
        "\"Oh, what a shame I couldn't see it. But how resourceful of you!\nHow did you happen to think of it?\"\n\n\"It just came to me,\" said George modestly.\n\nA serious look came into the girl's face. The smile died out of her\neyes. She shivered.\n\n\"When I think how some men might have behaved in your place!\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Any man would have done just what I did. Surely, knocking\noff Percy's hat was an act of simple courtesy which anyone would\nhave performed automatically!\"",
        "\"You might have been some awful bounder. Or, what would have been\nalmost worse, a slow-witted idiot who would have stopped to ask\nquestions before doing anything. To think I should have had the\nluck to pick you out of all London!\"\n\n\"I've been looking on it as a piece of luck--but entirely from my\nviewpoint.\"\n\nShe put a small hand on his arm, and spoke earnestly.\n\n\"Mr. Bevan, you mustn't think that, because I've been laughing a\ngood deal and have seemed to treat all this as a joke, you haven't",
        "saved me from real trouble. If you hadn't been there and hadn't\nacted with such presence of mind, it would have been terrible!\"\n\n\"But surely, if that fellow was annoying you, you could have called\na policeman?\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't anything like that. It was much, much worse. But I\nmustn't go on like this. It isn't fair on you.\" Her eyes lit up\nagain with the old shining smile. \"I know you have no curiosity\nabout me, but still there's no knowing whether I might not arouse",
        "some if I went on piling up the mystery. And the silly part is that\nreally there's no mystery at all. It's just that I can't tell\nanyone about it.\"\n\n\"That very fact seems to me to constitute the makings of a pretty\nfair mystery.\"\n\n\"Well, what I mean is, I'm not a princess in disguise trying to\nescape from anarchists, or anything like those things you read\nabout in books. I'm just in a perfectly simple piece of trouble.\nYou would be bored to death if I told you about it.\"\n\n\"Try me.\"",
        "She shook her head.\n\n\"No. Besides, here we are.\" The cab had stopped at the hotel, and a\ncommissionaire was already opening the door. \"Now, if you haven't\nrepented of your rash offer and really are going to be so awfully\nkind as to let me have that money, would you mind rushing off and\ngetting it, because I must hurry. I can just catch a good train,\nand it's hours to the next.\"\n\n\"Will you wait here? I'll be back in a moment.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"",
        "The last George saw of her was another of those exhilarating smiles\nof hers. It was literally the last he saw of her, for, when he\nreturned not more than two minutes later, the cab had gone, the\ngirl had gone, and the world was empty.\n\nTo him, gaping at this wholly unforeseen calamity the commissionaire\nvouchsafed information.\n\n\"The young lady took the cab on, sir.\"\n\n\"Took the cab on?\"\n\n\"Almost immediately after you had gone, sir, she got in again and\ntold the man to drive to Waterloo.\"",
        "George could make nothing of it. He stood there in silent\nperplexity, and might have continued to stand indefinitely, had not\nhis mind been distracted by a dictatorial voice at his elbow.\n\n\"You, sir! Dammit!\"\n\nA second taxi-cab had pulled up, and from it a stout, scarlet-\nfaced young man had sprung. One glance told George all. The hunt\nwas up once more. The bloodhound had picked up the trail. Percy was\nin again!\n\nFor the first time since he had become aware of her flight, George",
        "was thankful that the girl had disappeared. He perceived that he\nhad too quickly eliminated Percy from the list of the Things That\nMatter. Engrossed with his own affairs, and having regarded their\nlate skirmish as a decisive battle from which there would be no\nrallying, he had overlooked the possibility of this annoying and\nunnecessary person following them in another cab--a task which, in\nthe congested, slow-moving traffic, must have been a perfectly",
        "simple one. Well, here he was, his soul manifestly all stirred up\nand his blood-pressure at a far higher figure than his doctor would\nhave approved of, and the matter would have to be opened all over\nagain.\n\n\"Now then!\" said the stout young man.\n\nGeorge regarded him with a critical and unfriendly eye. He disliked\nthis fatty degeneration excessively. Looking him up and down, he\ncould find no point about him that gave him the least pleasure,",
        "with the single exception of the state of his hat, in the side of\nwhich he was rejoiced to perceive there was a large and unshapely\ndent.\n\n\"You thought you had shaken me off! You thought you'd given me the\nslip! Well, you're wrong!\"\n\nGeorge eyed him coldly.\n\n\"I know what's the matter with you,\" he said. \"Someone's been\nfeeding you meat.\"\n\nThe young man bubbled with fury. His face turned a deeper scarlet.\nHe gesticulated.\n\n\"You blackguard! Where's my sister?\"",
        "At this extraordinary remark the world rocked about George dizzily.\nThe words upset his entire diagnosis of the situation. Until that\nmoment he had looked upon this man as a Lothario, a pursuer of\ndamsels. That the other could possibly have any right on his side\nhad never occurred to him. He felt unmanned by the shock. It seemed\nto cut the ground from under his feet.\n\n\"Your sister!\"\n\n\"You heard what I said. Where is she?\"\n\nGeorge was still endeavouring to adjust his scattered faculties.",
        "He felt foolish and apologetic. He had imagined himself unassailably\nin the right, and it now appeared that he was in the wrong.\n\nFor a moment he was about to become conciliatory. Then the\nrecollection of the girl's panic and her hints at some trouble\nwhich threatened her--presumably through the medium of this man,\nbrother or no brother--checked him. He did not know what it was all\nabout, but the one thing that did stand out clearly in the welter",
        "of confused happenings was the girl's need for his assistance.\nWhatever might be the rights of the case, he was her accomplice,\nand must behave as such.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said.\n\nThe young man shook a large, gloved fist in his face.\n\n\"You blackguard!\"\n\nA rich, deep, soft, soothing voice slid into the heated scene like\nthe Holy Grail sliding athwart a sunbeam.\n\n\"What's all this?\"\n\nA vast policeman had materialized from nowhere. He stood beside",
        "them, a living statue of Vigilant Authority. One thumb rested\neasily on his broad belt. The fingers of the other hand caressed\nlightly a moustache that had caused more heart-burnings among the\ngentler sex than any other two moustaches in the C-division. The\neyes above the moustache were stern and questioning.\n\n\"What's all this?\"\n\nGeorge liked policemen. He knew the way to treat them. His voice,\nwhen he replied, had precisely the correct note of respectful\ndeference which the Force likes to hear.",
        "\"I really couldn't say, officer,\" he said, with just that air of\nhaving in a time of trouble found a kind elder brother to help him\nout of his difficulties which made the constable his ally on the\nspot. \"I was standing here, when this man suddenly made his\nextraordinary attack on me. I wish you would ask him to go away.\"\n\nThe policeman tapped the stout young man on the shoulder.\n\n\"This won't do, you know!\" he said austerely. \"This sort o' thing\nwon't do, 'ere, you know!\"",
        "\"Take your hands off me!\" snorted Percy.\n\nA frown appeared on the Olympian brow. Jove reached for his\nthunderbolts.\n\n\"'Ullo! 'Ullo! 'Ullo!\" he said in a shocked voice, as of a god\ndefied by a mortal. \"'Ullo! 'Ullo! 'Ul-lo!\"\n\nHis fingers fell on Percy's shoulder again, but this time not in a\nmere warning tap. They rested where they fell--in an iron clutch.\n\n\"It won't do, you know,\" he said. \"This sort o' thing won't do!\"\nMadness came upon the stout young man. Common prudence and the",
        "lessons of a carefully-taught youth fell from him like a garment.\nWith an incoherent howl he wriggled round and punched the policeman\nsmartly in the stomach.\n\n\"Ho!\" quoth the outraged officer, suddenly becoming human. His\nleft hand removed itself from the belt, and he got a businesslike\ngrip on his adversary's collar. \"Will you come along with me!\"\n\nIt was amazing. The thing had happened in such an incredibly brief\nspace of time. One moment, it seemed to George, he was the centre",
        "of a nasty row in one of the most public spots in London; the next,\nthe focus had shifted; he had ceased to matter; and the entire\nattention of the metropolis was focused on his late assailant, as,\nurged by the arm of the Law, he made that journey to Vine Street\nPolice Station which so many a better man than he had trod.\n\nGeorge watched the pair as they moved up the Haymarket, followed by\na growing and increasingly absorbed crowd; then he turned into the\nhotel.",
        "\"This,\" he said to himself; \"is the middle of a perfect day! And I\nthought London dull!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.\n\nGeorge awoke next morning with a misty sense that somehow the world\nhad changed. As the last remnants of sleep left him, he was aware\nof a vague excitement. Then he sat up in bed with a jerk. He had\nremembered that he was in love.\n\nThere was no doubt about it. A curious happiness pervaded his\nentire being. He felt young and active. Everything was emphatically",
        "for the best in this best of all possible worlds. The sun was\nshining. Even the sound of someone in the street below whistling\none of his old compositions, of which he had heartily sickened\ntwelve months before, was pleasant to his ears, and this in spite\nof the fact that the unseen whistler only touched the key in odd\nspots and had a poor memory for tunes. George sprang lightly out of\nbed, and turned on the cold tap in the bath-room. While he lathered",
        "his face for its morning shave he beamed at himself in the mirror.\n\nIt had come at last. The Real Thing.\n\nGeorge had never been in love before. Not really in love. True,\nfrom the age of fifteen, he had been in varying degrees of\nintensity attracted sentimentally by the opposite sex. Indeed, at\nthat period of life of which Mr. Booth Tarkington has written so\nsearchingly--the age of seventeen--he had been in love with\npractically every female he met and with dozens whom he had only",
        "seen in the distance; but ripening years had mellowed his taste and\nrobbed him of that fine romantic catholicity. During the last five\nyears women had found him more or less cold. It was the nature of\nhis profession that had largely brought about this cooling of the\nemotions. To a man who, like George, has worked year in and year\nout at the composition of musical comedies, woman comes to lose\nmany of those attractive qualities which ensnare the ordinary male.",
        "To George, of late years, it had begun to seem that the salient\nfeature of woman as a sex was her disposition to kick. For five\nyears he had been wandering in a world of women, many of them\nbeautiful, all of them superficially attractive, who had left no\nother impress on his memory except the vigour and frequency with\nwhich they had kicked. Some had kicked about their musical\nnumbers, some about their love-scenes; some had grumbled about",
        "their exit lines, others about the lines of their second-act\nfrocks. They had kicked in a myriad differing ways--wrathfully,\nsweetly, noisily, softly, smilingly, tearfully, pathetically and\npatronizingly; but they had all kicked; with the result that woman\nhad now become to George not so much a flaming inspiration or a\ntender goddess as something to be dodged--tactfully, if possible;\nbut, if not possible, by open flight. For years he had dreaded to",
        "be left alone with a woman, and had developed a habit of gliding\nswiftly away when he saw one bearing down on him.\n\nThe psychological effect of such a state of things is not difficult\nto realize. Take a man of naturally quixotic temperament, a man of\nchivalrous instincts and a feeling for romance, and cut him off for\nfive years from the exercise of those qualities, and you get an\naccumulated store of foolishness only comparable to an escape of",
        "gas in a sealed room or a cellarful of dynamite. A flicker of a\nmatch, and there is an explosion.\n\nThis girl's tempestuous irruption into his life had supplied flame\nfor George. Her bright eyes, looking into his, had touched off the\nspiritual trinitrotoluol which he had been storing up for so long.\nUp in the air in a million pieces had gone the prudence and\nself-restraint of a lifetime. And here he was, as desperately in\nlove as any troubadour of the Middle Ages.",
        "It was not till he had finished shaving and was testing the\ntemperature of his bath with a shrinking toe that the realization\ncame over him in a wave that, though he might be in love, the\nfairway of love was dotted with more bunkers than any golf course\nhe had ever played on in his life. In the first place, he did not\nknow the girl's name. In the second place, it seemed practically\nimpossible that he would ever see her again. Even in the midst of",
        "his optimism George could not deny that these facts might\nreasonably be considered in the nature of obstacles. He went back\ninto his bedroom, and sat on the bed. This thing wanted thinking\nover.\n\nHe was not depressed--only a little thoughtful. His faith in his\nluck sustained him. He was, he realized, in the position of a man\nwho has made a supreme drive from the tee, and finds his ball near\nthe green but in a cuppy lie. He had gained much; it now remained",
        "for him to push his success to the happy conclusion. The driver of\nLuck must be replaced by the spoon--or, possibly, the niblick--of\nIngenuity. To fail now, to allow this girl to pass out of his life\nmerely because he did not know who she was or where she was, would\nstamp him a feeble adventurer. A fellow could not expect Luck to\ndo everything for him. He must supplement its assistance with his\nown efforts.\n\nWhat had he to go on? Well, nothing much, if it came to that,",
        "except the knowledge that she lived some two hours by train out of\nLondon, and that her journey started from Waterloo Station. What\nwould Sherlock Holmes have done? Concentrated thought supplied no\nanswer to the question; and it was at this point that the cheery\noptimism with which he had begun the day left George and gave place\nto a grey gloom. A dreadful phrase, haunting in its pathos, crept\ninto his mind. \"Ships that pass in the night!\" It might easily turn",
        "out that way. Indeed, thinking over the affair in all its aspects\nas he dried himself after his tub, George could not see how it\ncould possibly turn out any other way.\n\nHe dressed moodily, and left the room to go down to breakfast.\nBreakfast would at least alleviate this sinking feeling which was\nunmanning him. And he could think more briskly after a cup or two\nof coffee.\n\nHe opened the door. On a mat outside lay a letter.\n\nThe handwriting was feminine. It was also in pencil, and strange to",
        "him. He opened the envelope.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Bevan\" (it began).\n\nWith a sudden leap of the heart he looked at the signature.\n\nThe letter was signed \"The Girl in the Cab.\"\n\n\n    \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,\n\n    \"I hope you won't think me very rude, running off\n    without waiting to say good-bye. I had to. I saw Percy\n    driving up in a cab, and knew that he must have followed us.\n    He did not see me, so I got away all right. I managed\n    splendidly about the money, for I remembered that I was",
        "wearing a nice brooch, and stopped on the way to the\n    station to pawn it.\n\n    \"Thank you ever so much again for all your wonderful\n    kindness.\n\n       Yours,\n       THE GIRL IN THE CAB.\"\n\n\nGeorge read the note twice on the way down to the breakfast room,\nand three times more during the meal; then, having committed its\ncontents to memory down to the last comma, he gave himself up to\nglowing thoughts.\n\nWhat a girl! He had never in his life before met a woman who could",
        "write a letter without a postscript, and this was but the smallest\nof her unusual gifts. The resource of her, to think of pawning that\nbrooch! The sweetness of her to bother to send him a note! More\nthan ever before was he convinced that he had met his ideal, and\nmore than ever before was he determined that a triviality like\nbeing unaware of her name and address should not keep him from her.\nIt was not as if he had no clue to go upon. He knew that she lived",
        "two hours from London and started home from Waterloo. It narrowed\nthe thing down absurdly. There were only about three counties in\nwhich she could possibly live; and a man must be a poor fellow who\nis incapable of searching through a few small counties for the girl\nhe loves. Especially a man with luck like his.\n\nLuck is a goddess not to be coerced and forcibly wooed by those who\nseek her favours. From such masterful spirits she turns away. But",
        "it happens sometimes that, if we put our hand in hers with the\nhumble trust of a little child, she will have pity on us, and not\nfail us in our hour of need. On George, hopefully watching for\nsomething to turn up, she smiled almost immediately.\n\nIt was George's practice, when he lunched alone, to relieve the\ntedium of the meal with the assistance of reading matter in the\nshape of one or more of the evening papers. Today, sitting down to",
        "a solitary repast at the Piccadilly grill-room, he had brought with\nhim an early edition of the Evening News. And one of the first\nitems which met his eye was the following, embodied in a column\non one of the inner pages devoted to humorous comments in prose and\nverse on the happenings of the day. This particular happening the\nwriter had apparently considered worthy of being dignified by\nrhyme. It was headed:\n\n    \"THE PEER AND THE POLICEMAN.\"",
        "\"Outside the 'Carlton,' 'tis averred, these stirring\n    happenings occurred. The hour, 'tis said (and no one\n    doubts) was half-past two, or thereabouts. The day was\n    fair, the sky was blue, and everything was peaceful too,\n    when suddenly a well-dressed gent engaged in heated\n    argument and roundly to abuse began another well-dressed\n    gentleman. His suede-gloved fist he raised on high to dot\n    the other in the eye. Who knows what horrors might have",
        "been, had there not come upon the scene old London city's\n    favourite son, Policeman C. 231.  'What means this conduct?\n    Prithee stop!' exclaimed that admirable slop. With which he\n    placed a warning hand upon the brawler's collarband. We\n    simply hate to tell the rest. No subject here for flippant\n    jest. The mere remembrance of the tale has made our ink\n    turn deadly pale. Let us be brief. Some demon sent stark\n    madness on the well-dressed gent. He gave the constable a",
        "punch just where the latter kept his lunch. The constable\n    said 'Well! Well! Well!' and marched him to a dungeon cell.\n    At Vine Street Station out it came--Lord Belpher was the\n    culprit's name. But British Justice is severe alike on\n    pauper and on peer; with even hand she holds the scale; a\n    thumping fine, in lieu of gaol, induced Lord B. to feel\n    remorse and learn he mustn't punch the Force.\"\n\nGeorge's mutton chop congealed on the plate, untouched. The French",
        "fried potatoes cooled off, unnoticed. This was no time for food.\nRightly indeed had he relied upon his luck. It had stood by him\nnobly. With this clue, all was over except getting to the nearest\nFree Library and consulting Burke's Peerage. He paid his bill and\nleft the restaurant.\n\nTen minutes later he was drinking in the pregnant information that\nBelpher was the family name of the Earl of Marshmoreton, and that\nthe present earl had one son, Percy Wilbraham Marsh, educ. Eton and",
        "Christ Church, Oxford, and what the book with its customary\ncurtness called \"one d.\"--Patricia Maud. The family seat, said\nBurke, was Belpher Castle, Belpher, Hants.\n\nSome hours later, seated in a first-class compartment of a train\nthat moved slowly out of Waterloo Station, George watched London\nvanish behind him. In the pocket closest to his throbbing heart\nwas a single ticket to Belpher.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6.\n\nAt about the time that George Bevan's train was leaving Waterloo, a",
        "grey racing car drew up with a grinding of brakes and a sputter of\ngravel in front of the main entrance of Belpher Castle. The slim\nand elegant young man at the wheel removed his goggles, pulled out\na watch, and addressed the stout young man at his side.\n\n\"Two hours and eighteen minutes from Hyde Park Corner, Boots. Not\nso dusty, what?\"\n\nHis companion made no reply. He appeared to be plunged in thought.\nHe, too, removed his goggles, revealing a florid and gloomy face,",
        "equipped, in addition to the usual features, with a small moustache\nand an extra chin. He scowled forbiddingly at the charming scene\nwhich the goggles had hidden from him.\n\nBefore him, a symmetrical mass of grey stone and green ivy, Belpher\nCastle towered against a light blue sky. On either side rolling\npark land spread as far as the eye could see, carpeted here and\nthere with violets, dotted with great oaks and ashes and Spanish",
        "chestnuts, orderly, peaceful and English. Nearer, on his left, were\nrose-gardens, in the centre of which, tilted at a sharp angle,\nappeared the seat of a pair of corduroy trousers, whose wearer\nseemed to be engaged in hunting for snails. Thrushes sang in the\ngreen shrubberies; rooks cawed in the elms. Somewhere in the\ndistance sounded the tinkle of sheep bells and the lowing of cows.\nIt was, in fact, a scene which, lit by the evening sun of a perfect",
        "spring day and fanned by a gentle westerly wind, should have\nbrought balm and soothing meditations to one who was the sole\nheir to all this Paradise.\n\nBut Percy, Lord Belpher, remained uncomforted by the notable\nco-operation of Man and Nature, and drew no solace from the\nreflection that all these pleasant things would one day be his own.\nHis mind was occupied at the moment, to the exclusion of all other\nthoughts, by the recollection of that painful scene in Bow Street",
        "Police Court. The magistrate's remarks, which had been tactless and\nunsympathetic, still echoed in his ears. And that infernal night in\nVine Street police station . . . The darkness . . . The hard bed. . .\nThe discordant vocalising of the drunk and disorderly in the\nnext cell. . . . Time might soften these memories, might lessen the\nsharp agony of them; but nothing could remove them altogether.\n\nPercy had been shaken to the core of his being. Physically, he was",
        "still stiff and sore from the plank bed. Mentally, he was a\nvolcano. He had been marched up the Haymarket in the full sight of\nall London by a bounder of a policeman. He had been talked to like\nan erring child by a magistrate whom nothing could convince that he\nhad not been under the influence of alcohol at the moment of his\narrest. (The man had said things about his liver, kindly\nbe-warned-in-time-and-pull-up-before-it-is-too-late things, which",
        "would have seemed to Percy indecently frank if spoken by his\nmedical adviser in the privacy of the sick chamber.) It is perhaps\nnot to be wondered at that Belpher Castle, for all its beauty of\nscenery and architecture, should have left Lord Belpher a little\ncold. He was seething with a fury which the conversation of Reggie\nByng had done nothing to allay in the course of the journey from\nLondon. Reggie was the last person he would willingly have chosen",
        "as a companion in his hour of darkness. Reggie was not soothing. He\nwould insist on addressing him by his old Eton nickname of Boots\nwhich Percy detested. And all the way down he had been breaking out\nat intervals into ribald comments on the recent unfortunate\noccurrence which were very hard to bear.\n\nHe resumed this vein as they alighted and rang the bell.\n\n\"This,\" said Reggie, \"is rather like a bit out of a melodrama.\nConvict son totters up the steps of the old home and punches the",
        "bell. What awaits him beyond? Forgiveness? Or the raspberry? True,\nthe white-haired butler who knew him as a child will sob on his\nneck, but what of the old dad? How will dad take the blot of the\nfamily escutcheon?\"\n\nLord Belpher's scowl deepened.\n\n\"It's not a joking matter,\" he said coldly.\n\n\"Great Heavens, I'm not joking. How could I have the heart to joke\nat a moment like this, when the friend of my youth has suddenly\nbecome a social leper?\"\n\n\"I wish to goodness you would stop.\"",
        "\"Do you think it is any pleasure to me to be seen about with a man\nwho is now known in criminal circles as Percy, the Piccadilly\nPoliceman-Puncher? I keep a brave face before the world, but\ninwardly I burn with shame and agony and what not.\"\n\nThe great door of the castle swung open, revealing Keggs, the\nbutler. He was a man of reverend years, portly and dignified, with\na respectfully benevolent face that beamed gravely on the young\nmaster and Mr. Byng, as if their coming had filled his cup of",
        "pleasure. His light, slightly protruding eyes expressed reverential\ngood will. He gave just that touch of cosy humanity to the scene\nwhich the hall with its half lights and massive furniture needed to\nmake it perfect to the returned wanderer. He seemed to be\nintimating that this was a moment to which he had looked forward\nlong, and that from now on quiet happiness would reign supreme. It\nis distressing to have to reveal the jarring fact that, in his",
        "hours of privacy when off duty, this apparently ideal servitor was\nso far from being a respecter of persons that he was accustomed to\nspeak of Lord Belpher as \"Percy\", and even as \"His Nibs\". It was,\nindeed, an open secret among the upper servants at the castle, and\na fact hinted at with awe among the lower, that Keggs was at heart\na Socialist.\n\n\"Good evening, your lordship. Good evening, sir.\"\n\nLord Belpher acknowledged the salutation with a grunt, but Reggie\nwas more affable.",
        "\"How are you, Keggs? Now's your time, if you're going to do it.\" He\nstepped a little to one side and indicated Lord Belpher's crimson\nneck with an inviting gesture.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\"\n\n\"Ah. You'd rather wait till you can do it a little more privately.\nPerhaps you're right.\"\n\nThe butler smiled indulgently. He did not understand what Reggie\nwas talking about, but that did not worry him. He had long since\ncome to the conclusion that Reggie was slightly mad, a theory",
        "supported by the latter's valet, who was of the same opinion. Keggs\ndid not dislike Reggie, but intellectually he considered him\nnegligible.\n\n\"Send something to drink into the library, Keggs,\" said Lord\nBelpher.\n\n\"Very good, your lordship.\"\n\n\"A topping idea,\" said Reggie. \"I'll just take the old car round to\nthe garage, and then I'll be with you.\"\n\nHe climbed to the steering wheel, and started the engine. Lord\nBelpher proceeded to the library, while Keggs melted away through",
        "the green baize door at the end of the hall which divided the\nservants' quarters from the rest of the house.\n\nReggie had hardly driven a dozen yards when he perceived his\nstepmother and Lord Marshmoreton coming towards him from the\ndirection of the rose-garden. He drew up to greet them.\n\n\"Hullo, mater. What ho, uncle! Back again at the old homestead,\nwhat?\"\n\nBeneath Lady Caroline's aristocratic front agitation seemed to\nlurk.\n\n\"Reggie, where is Percy?\"",
        "\"Old Boots? I think he's gone to the library. I just decanted him\nout of the car.\"\n\nLady Caroline turned to her brother.\n\n\"Let us go to the library, John.\"\n\n\"All right. All right. All right,\" said Lord Marshmoreton\nirritably. Something appeared to have ruffled his calm.\n\nReggie drove on. As he was strolling back after putting the car\naway he met Maud.\n\n\"Hullo, Maud, dear old thing.\"\n\n\"Why, hullo, Reggie. I was expecting you back last night.\"",
        "\"Couldn't get back last night. Had to stick in town and rally round\nold Boots. Couldn't desert the old boy in his hour of trial.\"\nReggie chuckled amusedly. \"'Hour of trial,' is rather good, what?\nWhat I mean to say is, that's just what it was, don't you know.\"\n\n\"Why, what happened to Percy?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you haven't heard? Of course not. It wouldn't\nhave been in the morning papers. Why, Percy punched a policeman.\"\n\n\"Percy did what?\"",
        "\"Slugged a slop. Most dramatic thing. Sloshed him in the midriff.\nAbsolutely. The cross marks the spot where the tragedy occurred.\"\n\nMaud caught her breath. Somehow, though she could not trace the\nconnection, she felt that this extraordinary happening must be\nlinked up with her escapade. Then her sense of humour got the\nbetter of apprehension. Her eyes twinkled delightedly.\n\n\"You don't mean to say Percy did that?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. The human tiger, and what not. Menace to Society and",
        "all that sort of thing. No holding him. For some unexplained reason\nthe generous blood of the Belphers boiled over, and then--zing.\nThey jerked him off to Vine Street. Like the poem, don't you know.\n'And poor old Percy walked between with gyves upon his wrists.' And\nthis morning, bright and early, the beak parted him from ten quid.\nYou know, Maud, old thing, our duty stares us plainly in the\neyeball. We've got to train old Boots down to a reasonable weight",
        "and spring him on the National Sporting Club. We've been letting a\nchampion middleweight blush unseen under our very roof tree.\"\n\nMaud hesitated a moment.\n\n\"I suppose you don't know,\" she asked carelessly, \"why he did it? I\nmean, did he tell you anything?\"\n\n\"Couldn't get a word out of him. Oysters garrulous and tombs chatty\nin comparison. Absolutely. All I know is that he popped one into\nthe officer's waistband. What led up to it is more than I can tell",
        "you. How would it be to stagger to the library and join the\npost-mortem?\"\n\n\"The post-mortem?\"\n\n\"Well, I met the mater and his lordship on their way to the\nlibrary, and it looked to me very much as if the mater must have\ngot hold of an evening paper on her journey from town. When did she\narrive?\"\n\n\"Only a short while ago.\"\n\n\"Then that's what's happened. She would have bought an evening\npaper to read in the train. By Jove, I wonder if she got hold of",
        "the one that had the poem about it. One chappie was so carried away\nby the beauty of the episode that he treated it in verse. I think\nwe ought to look in and see what's happening.\"\n\nMaud hesitated again. But she was a girl of spirit. And she had an\nintuition that her best defence would be attack. Bluff was what was\nneeded. Wide-eyed, innocent wonder . . . After all, Percy couldn't\nbe certain he had seen her in Piccadilly.\n\n\"All right.\"",
        "\"By the way, dear old girl,\" inquired Reggie, \"did your little\nbusiness come out satisfactorily? I forgot to ask.\"\n\n\"Not very. But it was awfully sweet of you to take me into town.\"\n\n\"How would it be,\" said Reggie nervously, \"not to dwell too much on\nthat part of it? What I mean to say is, for heaven's sake don't let\nthe mater know I rallied round.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Maud with a laugh. \"I'm not going to talk about\nthe thing at all.\"",
        "Lord Belpher, meanwhile, in the library, had begun with the aid of\na whisky and soda to feel a little better. There was something\nabout the library with its sombre half tones that soothed his\nbruised spirit. The room held something of the peace of a deserted\ncity. The world, with its violent adventures and tall policemen,\ndid not enter here. There was balm in those rows and rows of books\nwhich nobody ever read, those vast writing tables at which nobody",
        "ever wrote. From the broad mantel-piece the bust of some unnamed\nancient looked down almost sympathetically. Something remotely\nresembling peace had begun to steal into Percy's soul, when it was\nexpelled by the abrupt opening of the door and the entry of Lady\nCaroline Byng and his father. One glance at the face of the former\nwas enough to tell Lord Belpher that she knew all.\n\nHe rose defensively.\n\n\"Let me explain.\"\n\nLady Caroline quivered with repressed emotion. This masterly woman",
        "had not lost control of herself, but her aristocratic calm had\nseldom been so severely tested. As Reggie had surmised, she had read\nthe report of the proceedings in the evening paper in the train, and\nher world had been reeling ever since.

She had become inured to\nthe spectacle of her brother working in the garden in corduroy",

        "anything to injure the family prestige. And now, so to speak, \"Lo,\nBen Adhem's name led all the rest.\" In other words, Percy was the\nworst of the lot. Whatever indiscretions the rest had committed, at\nleast they had never got the family into the comic columns of the\nevening papers. Lord Marshmoreton might wear corduroy trousers and\nrefuse to entertain the County at garden parties and go to bed with\na book when it was his duty to act as host at a formal ball; Maud",
        "might give her heart to an impossible person whom nobody had ever\nheard of; and Reggie might be seen at fashionable restaurants with\npugilists; but at any rate evening paper poets had never written\nfacetious verses about their exploits. This crowning degradation had\nbeen reserved for the hitherto blameless Percy, who, of all the\nyoung men of Lady Caroline's acquaintance, had till now appeared to\nhave the most scrupulous sense of his position, the most rigid",
        "regard for the dignity of his great name. Yet, here he was, if the\ncarefully considered reports in the daily press were to be believed,\nspending his time in the very spring-tide of his life running about\nLondon like a frenzied Hottentot, brutally assaulting the police.\nLady Caroline felt as a bishop might feel if he suddenly discovered\nthat some favourite curate had gone over to the worship of Mumbo\nJumbo.\n\n\"Explain?\" she cried. \"How can you explain? You--my nephew, the",
        "heir to the title, behaving like a common rowdy in the streets of\nLondon . . . your name in the papers . . . \"\n\n\"If you knew the circumstances.\"\n\n\"The circumstances? They are in the evening paper. They are in\nprint.\"\n\n\"In verse,\" added Lord Marshmoreton. He chuckled amiably at the\nrecollection. He was an easily amused man. \"You ought to read it,\nmy boy. Some of it was capital . . .\"\n\n\"John!\"\n\n\"But deplorable, of course,\" added Lord Marshmoreton hastily. \"Very",
        "deplorable.\" He endeavoured to regain his sister's esteem by a show\nof righteous indignation. \"What do you mean by it, damn it? You're\nmy only son. I have watched you grow from child to boy, from boy to\nman, with tender solicitude. I have wanted to be proud of you. And\nall the time, dash it, you are prowling about London like a lion,\nseeking whom you may devour, terrorising the metropolis, putting\nharmless policemen in fear of their lives. . .\"",
        "\"Will you listen to me for a moment?\" shouted Percy. He began to\nspeak rapidly, as one conscious of the necessity of saying his say\nwhile the saying was good. \"The facts are these. I was walking\nalong Piccadilly on my way to lunch at the club, when, near\nBurlington Arcade, I was amazed to see Maud.\"\n\nLady Caroline uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"Maud? But Maud was here.\"\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" went on Lord Marshmoreton, pursuing his",
        "remarks. Righteous indignation had, he felt, gone well. It might be\njudicious to continue in that vein, though privately he held the\nopinion that nothing in Percy's life so became him as this assault\non the Force. Lord Marshmoreton, who in his time had committed all\nthe follies of youth, had come to look on his blameless son as\nscarcely human. \"It's not as if you were wild. You've never got\ninto any scrapes at Oxford. You've spent your time collecting old",
        "china and prayer rugs. You wear flannel next your skin . . .\"\n\n\"Will you please be quiet,\" said Lady Caroline impatiently. \"Go\non, Percy.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Lord Marshmoreton. \"I only spoke. I merely\nmade a remark.\"\n\n\"You say you saw Maud in Piccadilly, Percy?\"\n\n\"Precisely. I was on the point of putting it down to an extraordinary\nresemblance, when suddenly she got into a cab. Then I knew.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton could not permit this to pass in silence. He was\na fair-minded man.",
        "\"Why shouldn't the girl have got into a cab? Why must a girl\nwalking along Piccadilly be my daughter Maud just because she got\ninto a cab. London,\" he proceeded, warming to the argument and\nthrilled by the clearness and coherence of his reasoning, \"is full\nof girls who take cabs.\"\n\n\"She didn't take a cab.\"\n\n\"You just said she did,\" said Lord Marshmoreton cleverly.\n\n\"I said she got into a cab. There was somebody else already in the\ncab. A man. Aunt Caroline, it was the man.\"",
        "\"Good gracious,\" ejaculated Lady Caroline, falling into a chair as\nif she had been hamstrung.\n\n\"I am absolutely convinced of it,\" proceeded Lord Belpher solemnly.\n\"His behaviour was enough to confirm my suspicions. The cab had\nstopped in a block of the traffic, and I went up and requested him\nin a perfectly civil manner to allow me to look at the lady who had\njust got in. He denied that there was a lady in the cab. And I had\nseen her jump in with my own eyes. Throughout the conversation he",
        "was leaning out of the window with the obvious intention of\nscreening whoever was inside from my view. I followed him along\nPiccadilly in another cab, and tracked him to the Carlton. When I\narrived there he was standing on the pavement outside. There were\nno signs of Maud. I demanded that he tell me her whereabouts. . .\"\n\n\"That reminds me,\" said Lord Marshmoreton cheerfully, \"of a story I\nread in one of the papers. I daresay it's old. Stop me if you've",
        "heard it. A woman says to the maid: 'Do you know anything of my\nhusband's whereabouts?' And the maid replies--\"\n\n\"Do be quiet,\" snapped Lady Caroline. \"I should have thought that\nyou would be interested in a matter affecting the vital welfare of\nyour only daughter.\"\n\n\"I am. I am,\" said Lord Marshmoreton hastily. \"The maid replied:\n'They're at the wash.' Of course I am. Go on, Percy. Good God, boy,\ndon't take all day telling us your story.\"",
        "\"At that moment the fool of a policeman came up and wanted to know\nwhat the matter was. I lost my head. I admit it freely. The\npoliceman grasped my shoulder, and I struck him.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked Lord Marshmoreton, a stickler for detail.\n\n\"What does that matter?\" demanded Lady Caroline. \"You did quite\nright, Percy. These insolent jacks in office ought not to be\nallowed to manhandle people. Tell me, what this man was like?\"\n\n\"Extremely ordinary-looking. In fact, all I can remember about him",
        "was that he was clean-shaven. I cannot understand how Maud could\nhave come to lose her head over such a man. He seemed to me to\nhave no attraction whatever,\" said Lord Belpher, a little\nunreasonably, for Apollo himself would hardly appear attractive\nwhen knocking one's best hat off.\n\n\"It must have been the same man.\"\n\n\"Precisely. If we wanted further proof, he was an American. You\nrecollect that we heard that the man in Wales was American.\"",
        "There was a portentous silence. Percy stared at the floor. Lady\nCaroline breathed deeply. Lord Marshmoreton, feeling that something\nwas expected of him, said \"Good Gad!\" and gazed seriously at a\nstuffed owl on a bracket. Maud and Reggie Byng came in.\n\n\"What ho, what ho, what ho!\" said Reggie breezily. He always\nbelieved in starting a conversation well, and putting people at\ntheir ease. \"What ho! What ho!\"\n\nMaud braced herself for the encounter.",
        "\"Hullo, Percy, dear,\" she said, meeting her brother's accusing eye\nwith the perfect composure that comes only from a thoroughly guilty\nconscience. \"What's all this I hear about your being the Scourge of\nLondon? Reggie says that policemen dive down manholes when they see\nyou coming.\"\n\nThe chill in the air would have daunted a less courageous girl.\nLady Caroline had risen, and was staring sternly. Percy was puffing\nthe puffs of an overwrought soul. Lord Marshmoreton, whose thoughts",
        "had wandered off to the rose garden, pulled himself together and\ntried to look menacing. Maud went on without waiting for a reply.\nShe was all bubbling gaiety and insouciance, a charming picture of\nyoung English girlhood that nearly made her brother foam at the\nmouth.\n\n\"Father dear,\" she said, attaching herself affectionately to his\nbuttonhole, \"I went round the links in eighty-three this morning.\nI did the long hole in four. One under par, a thing I've never done",
        "before in my life.\" (\"Bless my soul,\" said Lord Marshmoreton\nweakly, as, with an apprehensive eye on his sister, he patted his\ndaughter's shoulder.) \"First, I sent a screecher of a drive right\ndown the middle of the fairway. Then I took my brassey and put the\nball just on the edge of the green. A hundred and eighty yards if\nit was an inch. My approach putt--\"\n\nLady Caroline, who was no devotee of the royal and ancient game,\ninterrupted the recital.",
        "\"Never mind what you did this morning. What did you do yesterday\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lord Belpher. \"Where were you yesterday afternoon?\"\n\nMaud's gaze was the gaze of a young child who has never even\nattempted to put anything over in all its little life.\n\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"What were you doing in Piccadilly yesterday afternoon?\" said Lady\nCaroline.\n\n\"Piccadilly? The place where Percy fights policemen? I don't\nunderstand.\"\n\nLady Caroline was no sportsman. She put one of those direct",
        "questions, capable of being answered only by \"Yes\" or \"No\", which\nought not to be allowed in controversy. They are the verbal\nequivalent of shooting a sitting bird.\n\n\"Did you or did you not go to London yesterday, Maud?\"\n\nThe monstrous unfairness of this method of attack pained Maud. From\nchildhood up she had held the customary feminine views upon the Lie\nDirect. As long as it was a question of suppression of the true or\nsuggestion of the false she had no scruples. But she had a",
        "distaste for deliberate falsehood. Faced now with a choice between\ntwo evils, she chose the one which would at least leave her\nself-respect.\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\nLady Caroline looked at Lord Belpher. Lord Belpher looked at\nLady Caroline.\n\n\"You went to meet that American of yours?\"\n\nReggie Byng slid softly from the room. He felt that he would be\nhappier elsewhere. He had been an acutely embarrassed spectator of\nthis distressing scene, and had been passing the time by shuffling",
        "his feet, playing with his coat buttons and perspiring.\n\n\"Don't go, Reggie,\" said Lord Belpher.\n\n\"Well, what I mean to say is--family row and what not--if you see\nwhat I mean--I've one or two things I ought to do--\"\n\nHe vanished. Lord Belpher frowned a sombre frown. \"Then it was\nthat man who knocked my hat off?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Lady Caroline. \"Knocked your hat off? You\nnever told me he knocked your hat off.\"\n\n\"It was when I was asking him to let me look inside the cab. I had",
        "grasped the handle of the door, when he suddenly struck my hat,\ncausing it to fly off. And, while I was picking it up, he drove\naway.\"\n\n\"C'k,\" exploded Lord Marshmoreton. \"C'k, c'k, c'k.\" He twisted his\nface by a supreme exertion of will power into a mask of\nindignation. \"You ought to have had the scoundrel arrested,\" he\nsaid vehemently. \"It was a technical assault.\"\n\n\"The man who knocked your hat off, Percy,\" said Maud, \"was\nnot . . . He was a different man altogether. A stranger.\"",
        "\"As if you would be in a cab with a stranger,\" said Lady Caroline\ncaustically. \"There are limits, I hope, to even your indiscretions.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton cleared his throat. He was sorry for Maud, whom\nhe loved.\n\n\"Now, looking at the matter broadly--\"\n\n\"Be quiet,\" said Lady Caroline.\n\nLord Marshmoreton subsided.\n\n\"I wanted to avoid you,\" said Maud, \"so I jumped into the first cab\nI saw.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Percy.\n\n\"It's the truth.\"\n\n\"You are simply trying to put us off the scent.\"",
        "Lady Caroline turned to Maud. Her manner was plaintive. She looked\nlike a martyr at the stake who deprecatingly lodges a timid\ncomplaint, fearful the while lest she may be hurting the feelings\nof her persecutors by appearing even for a moment out of sympathy\nwith their activities.\n\n\"My dear child, why will you not be reasonable in this matter? Why\nwill you not let yourself be guided by those who are older and\nwiser than you?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Lord Belpher.\n\n\"The whole thing is too absurd.\"",
        "\"Precisely,\" said Lord Belpher.\n\nLady Caroline turned on him irritably.\n\n\"Please do not interrupt, Percy. Now, you've made me forget what I\nwas going to say.\"\n\n\"To my mind,\" said Lord Marshmoreton, coming to the surface once\nmore, \"the proper attitude to adopt on occasions like the present--\"\n\n\"Please,\" said Lady Caroline.\n\nLord Marshmoreton stopped, and resumed his silent communion with the\nstuffed bird.\n\n\"You can't stop yourself being in love, Aunt Caroline,\" said Maud.",
        "\"You can be stopped if you've somebody with a level head looking\nafter you.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton tore himself away from the bird.\n\n\"Why, when I was at Oxford in the year '87,\" he said chattily, \"I\nfancied myself in love with the female assistant at a tobacconist\nshop. Desperately in love, dammit. Wanted to marry her. I recollect\nmy poor father took me away from Oxford and kept me here at Belpher\nunder lock and key. Lock and key, dammit. I was deucedly upset at",
        "the time, I remember.\" His mind wandered off into the glorious\npast. \"I wonder what that girl's name was. Odd one can't remember\nnames. She had chestnut hair and a mole on the side of her chin. I\nused to kiss it, I recollect--\"\n\nLady Caroline, usually such an advocate of her brother's researches\ninto the family history, cut the reminiscences short.\n\n\"Never mind that now.\"\n\n\"I don't. I got over it. That's the moral.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lady Caroline, \"at any rate poor father acted with",
        "great good sense on that occasion. There seems nothing to do but to\ntreat Maud in just the same way. You shall not stir a step from the\ncastle till you have got over this dreadful infatuation. You will\nbe watched.\"\n\n\"I shall watch you,\" said Lord Belpher solemnly, \"I shall watch\nyour every movement.\"\n\nA dreamy look came into Maud's brown eyes.\n\n\"Stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage,\" she said\nsoftly.\n\n\"That wasn't your experience, Percy, my boy,\" said Lord\nMarshmoreton.",
        "\"They make a very good imitation,\" said Lady Caroline coldly,\nignoring the interruption.\n\nMaud faced her defiantly. She looked like a princess in captivity\nfacing her gaolers.\n\n\"I don't care. I love him, and I always shall love him, and nothing\nis ever going to stop me loving him--because I love him,\" she\nconcluded a little lamely.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Lady Caroline. \"In a year from now you will have\nforgotten his name. Don't you agree with me, Percy?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Lord Belpher.\n\n\"I shan't.\"",
        "\"Deuced hard things to remember, names,\" said Lord Marshmoreton.\n\"If I've tried once to remember that tobacconist girl's name, I've\ntried a hundred times. I have an idea it began with an 'L.' Muriel\nor Hilda or something.\"\n\n\"Within a year,\" said Lady Caroline, \"you will be wondering how you\never came to be so foolish. Don't you think so, Percy?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Lord Belpher.\n\nLord Marshmoreton turned on him irritably.\n\n\"Good God, boy, can't you answer a simple question with a plain",
        "affirmative? What do you mean--quite? If somebody came to me and\npointed you out and said, 'Is that your son?' do you suppose I\nshould say 'Quite?' I wish the devil you didn't collect prayer\nrugs. It's sapped your brain.\"\n\n\"They say prison life often weakens the intellect, father,\" said\nMaud. She moved towards the door and turned the handle. Albert,\nthe page boy, who had been courting earache by listening at the\nkeyhole, straightened his small body and scuttled away. \"Well, is",
        "that all, Aunt Caroline? May I go now?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I have said all I wished to say.\"\n\n\"Very well. I'm sorry to disobey you, but I can't help it.\"\n\n\"You'll find you can help it after you've been cooped up here for a\nfew more months,\" said Percy.\n\nA gentle smile played over Maud's face.\n\n\"Love laughs at locksmiths,\" she murmured softly, and passed from\nthe room.\n\n\"What did she say?\" asked Lord Marshmoreton, interested.\n\"Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith? I don't",
        "understand. Why should anyone laugh at locksmiths? Most respectable\nmen. Had one up here only the day before yesterday, forcing open\nthe drawer of my desk. Watched him do it. Most interesting. He\nsmelt rather strongly of a damned bad brand of tobacco. Fellow must\nhave a throat of leather to be able to smoke the stuff. But he\ndidn't strike me as an object of derision. From first to last, I\nwas never tempted to laugh once.\"\n\nLord Belpher wandered moodily to the window and looked out into the",
        "gathering darkness.\n\n\"And this has to happen,\" he said bitterly, \"on the eve of my\ntwenty-first birthday.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7.\n\nThe first requisite of an invading army is a base. George, having\nentered Belpher village and thus accomplished the first stage in his\nforeward movement on the castle, selected as his base the Marshmoreton\nArms. Selected is perhaps hardly the right word, as it implies choice,\nand in George's case there was no choice. There are two inns at Belpher,",
        "but the Marshmoreton Arms is the only one that offers accommodation for\nman and beast, assuming--that is to say--that the man and beast desire\nto spend the night. The other house, the Blue Boar, is a mere beerhouse,\nwhere the lower strata of Belpher society gather of a night to quench\ntheir thirst and to tell one another interminable stories without any\npoint whatsoever. But the Marshmoreton Arms is a comfortable,\nrespectable hostelry, catering for the village plutocrats. There of an",
        "evening you will find the local veterinary surgeon smoking a pipe with\nthe grocer, the baker, and the butcher, with perhaps a sprinkling of\nneighbouring farmers to help the conversation along. On Saturdays there\nis a \"shilling ordinary\"--which is rural English for a cut off the joint\nand a boiled potato, followed by hunks of the sort of cheese which\nbelieves that it pays to advertise, and this is usually well attended.\nOn the other days of the week, until late in the evening, however, the",
        "visitor to the Marshmoreton Arms has the place almost entirely to\nhimself.\n\nIt is to be questioned whether in the whole length and breadth of\nthe world there is a more admirable spot for a man in love to pass\na day or two than the typical English village. The Rocky Mountains,\nthat traditional stamping-ground for the heartbroken, may be well\nenough in their way; but a lover has to be cast in a pretty stern\nmould to be able to be introspective when at any moment he may meet",
        "an annoyed cinnamon bear. In the English village there are no such\nobstacles to meditation. It combines the comforts of civilization\nwith the restfulness of solitude in a manner equalled by no other\nspot except the New York Public Library. Here your lover may wander\nto and fro unmolested, speaking to nobody, by nobody addressed, and\nhave the satisfaction at the end of the day of sitting down to a\ncapitally cooked chop and chips, lubricated by golden English ale.",
        "Belpher, in addition to all the advantages of the usual village,\nhas a quiet charm all its own, due to the fact that it has seen\nbetter days. In a sense, it is a ruin, and ruins are always\nsoothing to the bruised soul. Ten years before, Belpher had been a\nflourishing centre of the South of England oyster trade. It is\nsituated by the shore, where Hayling Island, lying athwart the\nmouth of the bay, forms the waters into a sort of brackish lagoon,",
        "in much the same way as Fire Island shuts off the Great South Bay\nof Long Island from the waves of the Atlantic. The water of Belpher\nCreek is shallow even at high tide, and when the tide runs out it\nleaves glistening mud flats, which it is the peculiar taste of the\noyster to prefer to any other habitation. For years Belpher oysters\nhad been the mainstay of gay supper parties at the Savoy, the\nCarlton and Romano's. Dukes doted on them; chorus girls wept if",
        "they were not on the bill of fare. And then, in an evil hour,\nsomebody discovered that what made the Belpher Oyster so\nparticularly plump and succulent was the fact that it breakfasted,\nlunched and dined almost entirely on the local sewage. There is but\na thin line ever between popular homage and execration. We see it\nin the case of politicians, generals and prize-fighters; and\noysters are no exception to the rule. There was a typhoid",
        "scare--quite a passing and unjustified scare, but strong enough to\ndo its deadly work; and almost overnight Belpher passed from a\nplace of flourishing industry to the sleepy, by-the-world-forgotten\nspot which it was when George Bevan discovered it. The shallow\nwater is still there; the mud is still there; even the oyster-beds\nare still there; but not the oysters nor the little world of\nactivity which had sprung up around them. The glory of Belpher is",
        "dead; and over its gates Ichabod is written. But, if it has lost in\nimportance, it has gained in charm; and George, for one, had no\nregrets. To him, in his present state of mental upheaval, Belpher\nwas the ideal spot.\n\nIt was not at first that George roused himself to the point of\nasking why he was here and what--now that he was here--he proposed\nto do. For two languorous days he loafed, sufficiently occupied\nwith his thoughts. He smoked long, peaceful pipes in the",
        "stable-yard, watching the ostlers as they groomed the horses; he\nplayed with the Inn puppy, bestowed respectful caresses on the Inn\ncat. He walked down the quaint cobbled street to the harbour,\nsauntered along the shore, and lay on his back on the little beach\nat the other side of the lagoon, from where he could see the red\nroofs of the village, while the imitation waves splashed busily on\nthe stones, trying to conceal with bustle and energy the fact that",
        "the water even two hundred yards from the shore was only eighteen\ninches deep. For it is the abiding hope of Belpher Creek that it\nmay be able to deceive the occasional visitor into mistaking it for\nthe open sea.\n\nAnd presently the tide would ebb. The waste of waters became a sea\nof mud, cheerfully covered as to much of its surface with green\ngrasses. The evening sun struck rainbow colours from the moist\nsoftness. Birds sang in the thickets. And George, heaving himself",
        "up, walked back to the friendly cosiness of the Marshmoreton Arms.\nAnd the remarkable part of it was that everything seemed perfectly\nnatural and sensible to him, nor had he any particular feeling that\nin falling in love with Lady Maud Marsh and pursuing her to Belpher\nhe had set himself anything in the nature of a hopeless task. Like\none kissed by a goddess in a dream, he walked on air; and, while\none is walking on air, it is easy to overlook the boulders in the\npath.",
        "Consider his position, you faint-hearted and self-pitying young men\nwho think you have a tough row to hoe just because, when you pay\nyour evening visit with the pound box of candy under your arm, you\nsee the handsome sophomore from Yale sitting beside her on the\nporch, playing the ukulele. If ever the world has turned black to\nyou in such a situation and the moon gone in behind a cloud, think\nof George Bevan and what he was up against. You are at least on the",
        "spot. You can at least put up a fight. If there are ukuleles in the\nworld, there are also guitars, and tomorrow it may be you and not\nhe who sits on the moonlit porch; it may be he and not you who\narrives late. Who knows? Tomorrow he may not show up till you have\nfinished the Bedouin's Love Song and are annoying the local birds,\nroosting in the trees, with Poor Butterfly.\n\nWhat I mean to say is, you are on the map. You have a sporting",
        "chance. Whereas George... Well, just go over to England and try\nwooing an earl's daughter whom you have only met once--and then\nwithout an introduction; whose brother's hat you have smashed\nbeyond repair; whose family wishes her to marry some other man: who\nwants to marry some other man herself--and not the same other man,\nbut another other man; who is closely immured in a mediaeval castle\n. . . Well, all I say is--try it. And then go back to your porch",
        "with a chastened spirit and admit that you might be a whole lot\nworse off.\n\nGeorge, as I say, had not envisaged the peculiar difficulties of\nhis position. Nor did he until the evening of his second day at the\nMarshmoreton Arms. Until then, as I have indicated, he roamed in a\ngolden mist of dreamy meditation among the soothing by-ways of the\nvillage of Belpher. But after lunch on the second day it came upon\nhim that all this sort of thing was pleasant but not practical.",
        "Action was what was needed. Action.\n\nThe first, the obvious move was to locate the castle. Inquiries at\nthe Marshmoreton Arms elicited the fact that it was \"a step\" up the\nroad that ran past the front door of the inn. But this wasn't the\nday of the week when the general public was admitted. The\nsightseer could invade Belpher Castle on Thursdays only, between\nthe hours of two and four. On other days of the week all he could\ndo was to stand like Moses on Pisgah and take in the general effect",
        "from a distance. As this was all that George had hoped to be able\nto do, he set forth.\n\nIt speedily became evident to George that \"a step\" was a euphemism.\nFive miles did he tramp before, trudging wearily up a winding lane,\nhe came out on a breeze-swept hill-top, and saw below him, nestling\nin its trees, what was now for him the centre of the world. He sat\non a stone wall and lit a pipe. Belpher Castle. Maud's home. There\nit was. And now what?",
        "The first thought that came to him was practical, even prosaic--\nthe thought that he couldn't possibly do this five-miles-there\nand-five-miles-back walk, every time he wanted to see the place.\nHe must shift his base nearer the scene of operations. One of those\ntrim, thatched cottages down there in the valley would be just the\nthing, if he could arrange to take possession of it. They sat there\nall round the castle, singly and in groups, like small dogs round",
        "their master. They looked as if they had been there for centuries.\nProbably they had, as they were made of stone as solid as that of\nthe castle. There must have been a time, thought George, when the\ncastle was the central rallying-point for all those scattered\nhomes; when rumour of danger from marauders had sent all that\nlittle community scuttling for safety to the sheltering walls.\n\nFor the first time since he had set out on his expedition, a",
        "certain chill, a discomforting sinking of the heart, afflicted\nGeorge as he gazed down at the grim grey fortress which he had\nundertaken to storm. So must have felt those marauders of old when\nthey climbed to the top of this very hill to spy out the land. And\nGeorge's case was even worse than theirs. They could at least hope\nthat a strong arm and a stout heart would carry them past those\nsolid walls; they had not to think of social etiquette. Whereas",
        "George was so situated that an unsympathetic butler could put him to\nrout by refusing him admittance.\n\nThe evening was drawing in. Already, in the brief time he had spent\non the hill-top, the sky had turned from blue to saffron and from\nsaffron to grey. The plaintive voices of homing cows floated up to\nhim from the valley below. A bat had left its shelter and was\nwheeling around him, a sinister blot against the sky. A sickle moon\ngleamed over the trees. George felt cold. He turned. The shadows",
        "of night wrapped him round, and little things in the hedgerows\nchirped and chittered mockery at him as he stumbled down the lane.\n\nGeorge's request for a lonely furnished cottage somewhere in the\nneighbourhood of the castle did not, as he had feared, strike the\nBelpher house-agent as the demand of a lunatic. Every well-dressed\nstranger who comes to Belpher is automatically set down by the\nnatives as an artist, for the picturesqueness of the place has",
        "caused it to be much infested by the brothers and sisters of the\nbrush. In asking for a cottage, indeed, George did precisely as\nBelpher society expected him to do; and the agent was reaching for\nhis list almost before the words were out of his mouth. In less\nthan half an hour George was out in the street again, the owner for\nthe season of what the agent described as a \"gem\" and the employer\nof a farmer's wife who lived near-by and would, as was her custom",
        "with artists, come in the morning and evening to \"do\" for him. The\ninterview would have taken but a few minutes, had it not been\nprolonged by the chattiness of the agent on the subject of the\noccupants of the castle, to which George listened attentively. He\nwas not greatly encouraged by what he heard of Lord Marshmoreton.\nThe earl had made himself notably unpopular in the village recently\nby his firm--the house-agent said \"pig-headed\"--attitude in respect",
        "to a certain dispute about a right-of-way. It was Lady Caroline,\nand not the easy-going peer, who was really to blame in the matter;\nbut the impression that George got from the house-agent's\ndescription of Lord Marshmoreton was that the latter was a sort of\nNero, possessing, in addition to the qualities of a Roman tyrant,\nmany of the least lovable traits of the ghila monster of Arizona.\nHearing this about her father, and having already had the privilege",
        "of meeting her brother and studying him at first hand, his heart\nbled for Maud. It seemed to him that existence at the castle in\nsuch society must be little short of torture.\n\n\"I must do something,\" he muttered. \"I must do something quick.\"\n\n\"Beg pardon,\" said the house-agent.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said George. \"Well, I'll take that cottage. I'd better\nwrite you a cheque for the first month's rent now.\"\n\nSo George took up his abode, full of strenuous--if vague--purpose,",
        "in the plainly-furnished but not uncomfortable cottage known\nlocally as \"the one down by Platt's.\" He might have found a worse\nbillet. It was a two-storied building of stained red brick, not one\nof the thatched nests on which he had looked down from the hill.\nThose were not for rent, being occupied by families whose ancestors\nhad occupied them for generations back. The one down by Platt's\nwas a more modern structure--a speculation, in fact, of the farmer",
        "whose wife came to \"do\" for George, and designed especially to\naccommodate the stranger who had the desire and the money to rent\nit. It so departed from type that it possessed a small but\nundeniable bath-room. Besides this miracle, there was a cosy\nsitting-room, a larger bedroom on the floor above and next to this\nan empty room facing north, which had evidently served artist\noccupants as a studio. The remainder of the ground floor was taken",
        "up by kitchen and scullery. The furniture had been constructed by\nsomebody who would probably have done very well if he had taken up\nsome other line of industry; but it was mitigated by a very fine\nand comfortable wicker easy chair, left there by one of last year's\nartists; and other artists had helped along the good work by\nrelieving the plainness of the walls with a landscape or two. In\nfact, when George had removed from the room two antimacassars,",
        "three group photographs of the farmer's relations, an illuminated\ntext, and a china statuette of the Infant Samuel, and stacked them\nin a corner of the empty studio, the place became almost a home\nfrom home.\n\nSolitude can be very unsolitary if a man is in love. George never\neven began to be bored. The only thing that in any way troubled his\npeace was the thought that he was not accomplishing a great deal in\nthe matter of helping Maud out of whatever trouble it was that had",
        "befallen her. The most he could do was to prowl about roads near\nthe castle in the hope of an accidental meeting. And such was his\ngood fortune that, on the fourth day of his vigil, the accidental\nmeeting occurred.\n\nTaking his morning prowl along the lanes, he was rewarded by the\nsight of a grey racing-car at the side of the road. It was empty,\nbut from underneath it protruded a pair of long legs, while beside\nit stood a girl, at the sight of whom George's heart began to thump",
        "so violently that the long-legged one might have been pardoned had\nhe supposed that his engine had started again of its own volition.\n\nUntil he spoke the soft grass had kept her from hearing his\napproach. He stopped close behind her, and cleared his throat. She\nstarted and turned, and their eyes met.\n\nFor a moment hers were empty of any recognition. Then they lit up.\nShe caught her breath quickly, and a faint flush came into her\nface.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" asked George.",
        "The long legs wriggled out into the road followed by a long body.\nThe young man under the car sat up, turning a grease-streaked and\npleasant face to George.\n\n\"Eh, what?\"\n\n\"Can I help you? I know how to fix a car.\"\n\nThe young man beamed in friendly fashion.\n\n\"It's awfully good of you, old chap, but so do I. It's the only\nthing I can do well. Thanks very much and so forth all the same.\"\n\nGeorge fastened his eyes on the girl's. She had not spoken.",
        "\"If there is anything in the world I can possibly do for you,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I hope you will let me know. I should like above all\nthings to help you.\"\n\nThe girl spoke.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said in a low voice almost inaudible.\n\nGeorge walked away. The grease-streaked young man followed him with\nhis gaze.\n\n\"Civil cove, that,\" he said. \"Rather gushing though, what?\nAmerican, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think he was.\"\n\n\"Americans are the civillest coves I ever struck. I remember asking",
        "the way of a chappie at Baltimore a couple of years ago when I was\nthere in my yacht, and he followed me for miles, shrieking advice\nand encouragement. I thought it deuced civil of him.\"\n\n\"I wish you would hurry up and get the car right, Reggie. We shall\nbe awfully late for lunch.\"\n\nReggie Byng began to slide backwards under the car.\n\n\"All right, dear heart. Rely on me. It's something quite simple.\"\n\n\"Well, do be quick.\"\n\n\"Imitation of greased lightning--very difficult,\" said Reggie",
        "encouragingly. \"Be patient. Try and amuse yourself somehow. Ask\nyourself a riddle. Tell yourself a few anecdotes. I'll be with you\nin a moment. I say, I wonder what the cove is doing at Belpher?\nDeuced civil cove,\" said Reggie approvingly. \"I liked him. And now,\nbusiness of repairing breakdown.\"\n\nHis smiling face vanished under the car like the Cheshire cat.\nMaud stood looking thoughtfully down the road in the direction in\nwhich George had disappeared.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8.",
        "The following day was a Thursday and on Thursdays, as has been\nstated, Belpher Castle was thrown open to the general public between\nthe hours of two and four. It was a tradition of long standing, this\nperiodical lowering of the barriers, and had always been faithfully\nobserved by Lord Marshmoreton ever since his accession to the title.\nBy the permanent occupants of the castle the day was regarded with\nmixed feelings. Lord Belpher, while approving of it in theory, as he",
        "did of all the family traditions--for he was a great supporter of\nall things feudal, and took his position as one of the hereditary\naristocracy of Great Britain extremely seriously--heartily disliked\nit in practice. More than once he had been obliged to exit hastily\nby a further door in order to keep from being discovered by a drove\nof tourists intent on inspecting the library or the great\ndrawing-room; and now it was his custom to retire to his bedroom",
        "immediately after lunch and not to emerge until the tide of invasion\nhad ebbed away.\n\nKeggs, the butler, always looked forward to Thursdays with\npleasurable anticipation. He enjoyed the sense of authority which\nit gave him to herd these poor outcasts to and fro among the\nsurroundings which were an everyday commonplace to himself. Also\nhe liked hearing the sound of his own voice as it lectured in\nrolling periods on the objects of interest by the way-side. But",
        "even to Keggs there was a bitter mixed with the sweet. No one was\nbetter aware than himself that the nobility of his manner,\nexcellent as a means of impressing the mob, worked against him when\nit came to a question of tips. Again and again had he been harrowed\nby the spectacle of tourists, huddled together like sheep, debating\namong themselves in nervous whispers as to whether they could offer\nthis personage anything so contemptible as half a crown for himself",
        "and deciding that such an insult was out of the question. It was\nhis endeavour, especially towards the end of the proceedings, to\ncultivate a manner blending a dignity fitting his position with a\nsunny geniality which would allay the timid doubts of the tourist\nand indicate to him that, bizarre as the idea might seem, there was\nnothing to prevent him placing his poor silver in more worthy\nhands.\n\nPossibly the only member of the castle community who was absolutely",
        "indifferent to these public visits was Lord Marshmoreton. He made\nno difference between Thursday and any other day. Precisely as\nusual he donned his stained corduroys and pottered about his\nbeloved garden; and when, as happened on an average once a quarter,\nsome visitor, strayed from the main herd, came upon him as he\nworked and mistook him for one of the gardeners, he accepted the\nerror without any attempt at explanation, sometimes going so far as",
        "to encourage it by adopting a rustic accent in keeping with his\nappearance. This sort of thing tickled the simple-minded peer.\n\nGeorge joined the procession punctually at two o'clock, just as\nKeggs was clearing his throat preparatory to saying, \"We are now in\nthe main 'all, and before going any further I would like to call\nyour attention to Sir Peter Lely's portrait of--\" It was his custom\nto begin his Thursday lectures with this remark, but today it was",
        "postponed; for, no sooner had George appeared, than a breezy voice\non the outskirts of the throng spoke in a tone that made\ncompetition impossible.\n\n\"For goodness' sake, George.\"\n\nAnd Billie Dore detached herself from the group, a trim vision in\nblue. She wore a dust-coat and a motor veil, and her eyes and\ncheeks were glowing from the fresh air.\n\n\"For goodness' sake, George, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I was just going to ask you the same thing.\"",
        "\"Oh, I motored down with a boy I know. We had a breakdown just\noutside the gates. We were on our way to Brighton for lunch. He\nsuggested I should pass the time seeing the sights while he fixed\nup the sprockets or the differential gear or whatever it was. He's\ncoming to pick me up when he's through. But, on the level, George,\nhow do you get this way? You sneak out of town and leave the show\nflat, and nobody has a notion where you are. Why, we were thinking",
        "of advertising for you, or going to the police or something. For\nall anybody knew, you might have been sandbagged or dropped in the\nriver.\"\n\nThis aspect of the matter had not occurred to George till now. His\nsudden descent on Belpher had seemed to him the only natural course\nto pursue. He had not realized that he would be missed, and that\nhis absence might have caused grave inconvenience to a large number\nof people.\n\n\"I never thought of that. I--well, I just happened to come here.\"",
        "\"You aren't living in this old castle?\"\n\n\"Not quite. I've a cottage down the road. I wanted a few days in\nthe country so I rented it.\"\n\n\"But what made you choose this place?\"\n\nKeggs, who had been regarding these disturbers of the peace with\ndignified disapproval, coughed.\n\n\"If you would not mind, madam. We are waiting.\"\n\n\"Eh? How's that?\" Miss Dore looked up with a bright smile. \"I'm\nsorry. Come along, George. Get in the game.\" She nodded cheerfully",
        "to the butler. \"All right. All set now. You may fire when ready,\nGridley.\"\n\nKeggs bowed austerely, and cleared his throat again.\n\n\"We are now in the main 'all, and before going any further I would\nlike to call your attention to Sir Peter Lely's portrait of the\nfifth countess. Said by experts to be in his best manner.\"\n\nThere was an almost soundless murmur from the mob, expressive of\nwonder and awe, like a gentle breeze rustling leaves. Billie Dore\nresumed her conversation in a whisper.",
        "\"Yes, there was an awful lot of excitement when they found that you\nhad disappeared. They were phoning the Carlton every ten minutes\ntrying to get you. You see, the summertime number flopped on the\nsecond night, and they hadn't anything to put in its place. But\nit's all right. They took it out and sewed up the wound, and now\nyou'd never know there had been anything wrong. The show was ten\nminutes too long, anyway.\"\n\n\"How's the show going?\"",
        "\"It's a riot. They think it will run two years in London. As far\nas I can make it out you don't call it a success in London unless\nyou can take your grandchildren to see the thousandth night.\"\n\n\"That's splendid. And how is everybody? All right?\"\n\n\"Fine. That fellow Gray is still hanging round Babe. It beats me\nwhat she sees in him. Anybody but an infant could see the man\nwasn't on the level. Well, I don't blame you for quitting London,\nGeorge. This sort of thing is worth fifty Londons.\"",
        "The procession had reached one of the upper rooms, and they were\nlooking down from a window that commanded a sweep of miles of the\ncountryside, rolling and green and wooded. Far away beyond the last\ncovert Belpher Bay gleamed like a streak of silver. Billie Dore\ngave a little sigh.\n\n\"There's nothing like this in the world. I'd like to stand here for\nthe rest of my life, just lapping it up.\"\n\n\"I will call your attention,\" boomed Keggs at their elbow, \"to this",
        "window, known in the fem'ly tredition as Leonard's Leap. It was in\nthe year seventeen 'undred and eighty-seven that Lord Leonard\nForth, eldest son of 'Is Grace the Dook of Lochlane, 'urled 'imself\nout of this window in order to avoid compromising the beautiful\nCountess of Marshmoreton, with oom 'e is related to 'ave 'ad a\nninnocent romance. Surprised at an advanced hour by 'is lordship\nthe earl in 'er ladyship's boudoir, as this room then was, 'e",
        "leaped through the open window into the boughs of the cedar tree\nwhich stands below, and was fortunate enough to escape with a few\n'armless contusions.\"\n\nA murmur of admiration greeted the recital of the ready tact of\nthis eighteenth-century Steve Brodie.\n\n\"There,\" said Billie enthusiastically, \"that's exactly what I mean\nabout this country. It's just a mass of Leonard's Leaps and things.\nI'd like to settle down in this sort of place and spend the rest of",
        "my life milking cows and taking forkfuls of soup to the deserving\nvillagers.\"\n\n\"We will now,\" said Keggs, herding the mob with a gesture, \"proceed\nto the Amber Drawing-Room, containing some Gobelin Tapestries\n'ighly spoken of by connoozers.\"\n\nThe obedient mob began to drift out in his wake.\n\n\"What do you say, George,\" asked Billie in an undertone, \"if we\nside-step the Amber Drawing-Room? I'm wild to get into that garden.\nThere's a man working among those roses. Maybe he would show us\nround.\"",
        "George followed her pointing finger. Just below them a sturdy,\nbrown-faced man in corduroys was pausing to light a stubby pipe.\n\n\"Just as you like.\"\n\nThey made their way down the great staircase. The voice of Keggs,\nsaying complimentary things about the Gobelin Tapestry, came to\ntheir ears like the roll of distant drums. They wandered out\ntowards the rose-garden. The man in corduroys had lit his pipe and\nwas bending once more to his task.\n\n\"Well, dadda,\" said Billie amiably, \"how are the crops?\"",
        "The man straightened himself. He was a nice-looking man of middle\nage, with the kind eyes of a friendly dog. He smiled genially, and\nstarted to put his pipe away.\n\nBillie stopped him.\n\n\"Don't stop smoking on my account,\" she said. \"I like it. Well,\nyou've got the right sort of a job, haven't you! If I was a man,\nthere's nothing I'd like better than to put in my eight hours in a\nrose-garden.\" She looked about her. \"And this,\" she said with\napproval, \"is just what a rose-garden ought to be.\"",
        "\"Are you fond of roses--missy?\"\n\n\"You bet I am! You must have every kind here that was ever\ninvented. All the fifty-seven varieties.\"\n\n\"There are nearly three thousand varieties,\" said the man in\ncorduroys tolerantly.\n\n\"I was speaking colloquially, dadda. You can't teach me anything\nabout roses. I'm the guy that invented them. Got any Ayrshires?\"\n\nThe man in corduroys seemed to have come to the conclusion that\nBillie was the only thing on earth that mattered. This revelation",
        "of a kindred spirit had captured him completely. George was merely\namong those present.\n\n\"Those--them--over there are Ayrshires, missy.\"\n\n\"We don't get Ayrshires in America. At least, I never ran across\nthem. I suppose they do have them.\"\n\n\"You want the right soil.\"\n\n\"Clay and lots of rain.\"\n\n\"You're right.\"\n\nThere was an earnest expression on Billie Dore's face that George\nhad never seen there before.\n\n\"Say, listen, dadda, in this matter of rose-beetles, what would you\ndo if--\"",
        "George moved away. The conversation was becoming too technical for\nhim, and he had an idea that he would not be missed. There had come\nto him, moreover, in a flash one of those sudden inspirations which\ngreat generals get. He had visited the castle this afternoon\nwithout any settled plan other than a vague hope that he might\nsomehow see Maud. He now perceived that there was no chance of\ndoing this. Evidently, on Thursdays, the family went to earth and",
        "remained hidden until the sightseers had gone. But there was\nanother avenue of communication open to him. This gardener seemed\nan exceptionally intelligent man. He could be trusted to deliver a\nnote to Maud.\n\nIn his late rambles about Belpher Castle in the company of Keggs\nand his followers, George had been privileged to inspect the\nlibrary. It was an easily accessible room, opening off the main\nhall. He left Billie and her new friend deep in a discussion of",
        "slugs and plant-lice, and walked quickly back to the house. The\nlibrary was unoccupied.\n\nGeorge was a thorough young man. He believed in leaving nothing to\nchance. The gardener had seemed a trustworthy soul, but you never\nknew. It was possible that he drank. He might forget or lose the\nprecious note. So, with a wary eye on the door, George hastily\nscribbled it in duplicate. This took him but a few minutes. He went\nout into the garden again to find Billie Dore on the point of",
        "stepping into a blue automobile.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, George. I wondered where you had got to. Say, I\nmade quite a hit with dadda. I've given him my address, and he's\npromised to send me a whole lot of roses. By the way, shake hands\nwith Mr. Forsyth. This is George Bevan, Freddie, who wrote the\nmusic of our show.\"\n\nThe solemn youth at the wheel extended a hand.\n\n\"Topping show. Topping music. Topping all round.\"\n\n\"Well, good-bye, George. See you soon, I suppose?\"",
        "\"Oh, yes. Give my love to everybody.\"\n\n\"All right. Let her rip, Freddie. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nThe blue car gathered speed and vanished down the drive. George\nreturned to the man in corduroys, who had bent himself double in\npursuit of a slug.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" said George hurriedly. He pulled out the first of\nthe notes. \"Give this to Lady Maud the first chance you get. It's\nimportant. Here's a sovereign for your trouble.\"\n\nHe hastened away. He noticed that gratification had turned the",
        "other nearly purple in the face, and was anxious to leave him. He\nwas a modest young man, and effusive thanks always embarrassed him.\n\nThere now remained the disposal of the duplicate note. It was\nhardly worth while, perhaps, taking such a precaution, but George\nknew that victories are won by those who take no chances. He had\nwandered perhaps a hundred yards from the rose-garden when he\nencountered a small boy in the many-buttoned uniform of a page. The",
        "boy had appeared from behind a big cedar, where, as a matter of\nfact, he had been smoking a stolen cigarette.\n\n\"Do you want to earn half a crown?\" asked George.\n\nThe market value of messengers had slumped.\n\nThe stripling held his hand out.\n\n\"Give this note to Lady Maud.\"\n\n\"Right ho!\"\n\n\"See that it reaches her at once.\"\n\nGeorge walked off with the consciousness of a good day's work done.\nAlbert the page, having bitten his half-crown, placed it in his",
        "pocket. Then he hurried away, a look of excitement and gratification\nin his deep blue eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9.\n\nWhile George and Billie Dore wandered to the rose garden to\ninterview the man in corduroys, Maud had been seated not a hundred\nyards away--in a very special haunt of her own, a cracked stucco\ntemple set up in the days of the Regency on the shores of a little\nlily-covered pond. She was reading poetry to Albert the page.\n\nAlbert the page was a recent addition to Maud's inner circle. She",
        "had interested herself in him some two months back in much the same\nspirit as the prisoner in his dungeon cell tames and pets the\nconventional mouse. To educate Albert, to raise him above his\ngroove in life and develop his soul, appealed to her romantic\nnature as a worthy task, and as a good way of filling in the time.\nIt is an exceedingly moot point--and one which his associates of\nthe servants' hall would have combated hotly--whether Albert",
        "possessed a soul. The most one could say for certain is that he\nlooked as if he possessed one. To one who saw his deep blue eyes\nand their sweet, pensive expression as they searched the middle\ndistance he seemed like a young angel. How was the watcher to know\nthat the thought behind that far-off gaze was simply a speculation\nas to whether the bird on the cedar tree was or was not within\nrange of his catapult? Certainly Maud had no such suspicion. She",
        "worked hopefully day by day to rouse Albert to an appreciation of\nthe nobler things of life.\n\nNot but what it was tough going. Even she admitted that. Albert's\nsoul did not soar readily. It refused to leap from the earth. His\nreception of the poem she was reading could scarcely have been\ncalled encouraging. Maud finished it in a hushed voice, and looked\npensively across the dappled water of the pool. A gentle breeze\nstirred the water-lilies, so that they seemed to sigh.",
        "\"Isn't that beautiful, Albert?\" she said.\n\nAlbert's blue eyes lit up. His lips parted eagerly,\n\n\"That's the first hornet I seen this year,\" he said pointing.\n\nMaud felt a little damped.\n\n\"Haven't you been listening, Albert?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, m'lady! Ain't he a wopper, too?\"\n\n\"Never mind the hornet, Albert.\"\n\n\"Very good, m'lady.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't say 'Very good, m'lady'. It's like--like--\"\nShe paused. She had been about to say that it was like a butler,",
        "but, she reflected regretfully, it was probably Albert's dearest\nambition to be like a butler. \"It doesn't sound right. Just say\n'Yes'.\"\n\n\"Yes, m'lady.\"\n\nMaud was not enthusiastic about the 'M'lady', but she let it go.\nAfter all, she had not quite settled in her own mind what exactly\nshe wished Albert's attitude towards herself to be. Broadly\nspeaking, she wanted him to be as like as he could to a medieval\npage, one of those silk-and-satined little treasures she had read",
        "about in the Ingoldsby Legends. And, of course, they presumably\nsaid 'my lady'. And yet--she felt--not for the first time--that it\nis not easy, to revive the Middle Ages in these curious days. Pages\nlike other things, seem to have changed since then.\n\n\"That poem was written by a very clever man who married one of my\nancestresses. He ran away with her from this very castle in the\nseventeenth century.\"\n\n\"Lor'\", said Albert as a concession, but he was still interested in\nthe hornet.",
        "\"He was far below her in the eyes of the world, but she knew what a\nwonderful man he was, so she didn't mind what people said about her\nmarrying beneath her.\"\n\n\"Like Susan when she married the pleeceman.\"\n\n\"Who was Susan?\"\n\n\"Red-'eaded gel that used to be cook 'ere. Mr. Keggs says to 'er,\n'e says, 'You're marrying beneath you, Susan', 'e says. I 'eard\n'im. I was listenin' at the door. And she says to 'im, she says,\n'Oh, go and boil your fat 'ead', she says.\"",
        "This translation of a favourite romance into terms of the servants'\nhall chilled Maud like a cold shower. She recoiled from it.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to get a good education, Albert,\" she said\nperseveringly, \"and become a great poet and write wonderful poems?\"\n\nAlbert considered the point, and shook his head.\n\n\"No, m'lady.\"\n\nIt was discouraging. But Maud was a girl of pluck. You cannot leap\ninto strange cabs in Piccadilly unless you have pluck. She picked\nup another book from the stone seat.",
        "\"Read me some of this,\" she said, \"and then tell me if it doesn't\nmake you feel you want to do big things.\"\n\nAlbert took the book cautiously. He was getting a little fed up\nwith all this sort of thing. True, 'er ladyship gave him chocolates\nto eat during these sessions, but for all that it was too much like\nschool for his taste. He regarded the open page with disfavour.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Maud, closing her eyes. \"It's very beautiful.\"\n\nAlbert began. He had a husky voice, due, it is to be feared,",
        "to precocious cigarette smoking, and his enunciation was not as\ngood as it might have been.\n\n    \"Wiv' blekest morss the flower-ports\n      Was-I mean were-crusted one and orl;\n    Ther rusted niles fell from the knorts\n      That 'eld the pear to the garden-worll.\n    Ther broken sheds looked sed and stringe;\n      Unlifted was the clinking latch;\n      Weeded and worn their ancient thatch\n    Er-pon ther lownely moated gringe,\n      She only said 'Me life is dreary,",
        "'E cometh not,' she said.\"\n\n\nAlbert rather liked this part. He was never happy in narrative\nunless it could be sprinkled with a plentiful supply of \"he said's\"\nand \"she said's.\" He finished with some gusto.\n\n    \"She said - I am aweary, aweary,\n     I would that I was dead.\"\n\nMaud had listened to this rendition of one of her most adored poems\nwith much the same feeling which a composer with an over-sensitive\near would suffer on hearing his pet opus assassinated by a",
        "schoolgirl. Albert, who was a willing lad and prepared, if such\nshould be her desire, to plough his way through the entire seven\nstanzas, began the second verse, but Maud gently took the book away\nfrom him. Enough was sufficient.\n\n\"Now, wouldn't you like to be able to write a wonderful thing like\nthat, Albert?\"\n\n\"Not me, m'lady.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like to be a poet when you grow up?\"\n\nAlbert shook his golden head.\n\n\"I want to be a butcher when I grow up, m'lady.\"\n\nMaud uttered a little cry.",
        "\"A butcher?\"\n\n\"Yus, m'lady. Butchers earn good money,\" he said, a light of\nenthusiasm in his blue eyes, for he was now on his favourite\nsubject. \"You've got to 'ave meat, yer see, m'lady. It ain't like\npoetry, m'lady, which no one wants.\"\n\n\"But, Albert,\" cried Maud faintly. \"Killing poor animals. Surely\nyou wouldn't like that?\"\n\nAlbert's eyes glowed softly, as might an acolyte's at the sight of\nthe censer.\n\n\"Mr. Widgeon down at the 'ome farm,\" he murmured reverently, \"he",
        "says, if I'm a good boy, 'e'll let me watch 'im kill a pig\nToosday.\"\n\nHe gazed out over the water-lilies, his thoughts far away. Maud\nshuddered. She wondered if medieval pages were ever quite as earthy\nas this.\n\n\"Perhaps you had better go now, Albert. They may be needing you in\nthe house.\"\n\n\"Very good, m'lady.\"\n\nAlbert rose, not unwilling to call it a day. He was conscious of\nthe need for a quiet cigarette. He was fond of Maud, but a man\ncan't spend all his time with the women.",
        "\"Pigs squeal like billy-o, m'lady!\" he observed by way of adding a\nparting treasure to Maud's stock of general knowledge.  \"Oo! 'Ear\n'em a mile orf, you can!\"\n\nMaud remained where she was, thinking, a wistful figure.\nTennyson's \"Mariana\" always made her wistful even when rendered by\nAlbert. In the occasional moods of sentimental depression which\ncame to vary her normal cheerfulness, it seemed to her that the\npoem might have been written with a prophetic eye to her special",
        "case, so nearly did it crystallize in magic words her own story.\n\n        \"With blackest moss the flower-pots\n         Were thickly crusted, one and all.\"\n\nWell, no, not that particular part, perhaps. If he had found so\nmuch as one flower-pot of his even thinly crusted with any foreign\nsubstance, Lord Marshmoreton would have gone through the place like\nan east wind, dismissing gardeners and under-gardeners with every\nbreath. But--\n\n         \"She only said 'My life is dreary,",
        "He cometh not,' she said.\n         She said 'I am aweary, aweary.\n            I would that I were dead!\"\n\nHow exactly--at these moments when she was not out on the links\npicking them off the turf with a midiron or engaged in one of those\nother healthful sports which tend to take the mind off its\ntroubles--those words summed up her case.\n\nWhy didn't Geoffrey come? Or at least write? She could not write to\nhim. Letters from the castle left only by way of the castle",
        "post-bag, which Rogers, the chauffeur, took down to the village\nevery evening. Impossible to entrust the kind of letter she wished\nto write to any mode of delivery so public--especially now, when\nher movements were watched. To open and read another's letters is a\nlow and dastardly act, but she believed that Lady Caroline would do\nit like a shot. She longed to pour out her heart to Geoffrey in a\nlong, intimate letter, but she did not dare to take the risk of",
        "writing for a wider public. Things were bad enough as it was, after\nthat disastrous sortie to London.\n\nAt this point a soothing vision came to her--the vision of George\nBevan knocking off her brother Percy's hat. It was the only\npleasant thing that had happened almost as far back as she could\nremember. And then, for the first time, her mind condescended to\ndwell for a moment on the author of that act, George Bevan, the\nfriend in need, whom she had met only the day before in the lane.",
        "What was George doing at Belpher?  His presence there was\nsignificant, and his words even more so. He had stated explicitly\nthat he wished to help her.\n\nShe found herself oppressed by the irony of things. A knight had\ncome to the rescue--but the wrong knight. Why could it not have\nbeen Geoffrey who waited in ambush outside the castle, and not a\npleasant but negligible stranger? Whether, deep down in her\nconsciousness, she was aware of a fleeting sense of disappointment",
        "in Geoffrey, a swiftly passing thought that he had failed her, she\ncould hardly have said, so quickly did she crush it down.\n\nShe pondered on the arrival of George. What was the use of his\nbeing somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing\nwhere she could find him? Situated as she was, she could not wander\nat will about the countryside, looking for him. And, even if she\nfound him, what then? There was not much that any stranger, however\npleasant, could do.",
        "She flushed at a sudden thought. Of course there was something\nGeorge could do for her if he were willing. He could receive,\ndespatch and deliver letters. If only she could get in touch with\nhim, she could--through him--get in touch with Geoffrey.\n\nThe whole world changed for her. The sun was setting and chill\nlittle winds had begun to stir the lily-pads, giving a depressing\nair to the scene, but to Maud it seemed as if all Nature smiled.",
        "With the egotism of love, she did not perceive that what she\nproposed to ask George to do was practically to fulfil the humble\nrole of the hollow tree in which lovers dump letters, to be\nextracted later; she did not consider George's feelings at all. He\nhad offered to help her, and this was his job. The world is full of\nGeorges whose task it is to hang about in the background and make\nthemselves unobtrusively useful.\n\nShe had reached this conclusion when Albert, who had taken a short",
        "cut the more rapidly to accomplish his errand, burst upon her\ndramatically from the heart of a rhododendron thicket.\n\n\"M'lady! Gentleman give me this to give yer!\"\n\nMaud read the note. It was brief, and to the point.\n\n    \"I am staying near the castle at a cottage they call 'the\n    one down by Platt's'. It is a rather new, red-brick place.\n    You can easily find it. I shall be waiting there if you want\n    me.\"\n\nIt was signed \"The Man in the Cab\".",
        "\"Do you know a cottage called 'the one down by Platt's', Albert?\"\nasked Maud.\n\n\"Yes, m'lady. It's down by Platt's farm. I see a chicken killed\nthere Wednesday week. Do you know, m'lady, after a chicken's 'ead\nis cut orf, it goes running licketty-split?\"\n\nMaud shivered slightly. Albert's fresh young enthusiasms frequently\njarred upon her.\n\n\"I find a friend of mine is staying there. I want you to take a\nnote to him from me.\"\n\n\"Very good, m'lady.\"\n\n\"And, Albert--\"\n\n\"Yes, m'lady?\"",
        "\"Perhaps it would be as well if you said nothing about this to any\nof your friends.\"\n\nIn Lord Marshmoreton's study a council of three was sitting in\ndebate. The subject under discussion was that other note which\nGeorge had written and so ill-advisedly entrusted to one whom he\nhad taken for a guileless gardener. The council consisted of Lord\nMarshmoreton, looking rather shamefaced, his son Percy looking\nswollen and serious, and Lady Caroline Byng, looking like a tragedy\nqueen.",
        "\"This,\" Lord Belpher was saying in a determined voice, \"settles it.\nFrom now on Maud must not be allowed out of our sight.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton spoke.\n\n\"I rather wish,\" he said regretfully, \"I hadn't spoken about the\nnote. I only mentioned it because I thought you might think it\namusing.\"\n\n\"Amusing!\" Lady Caroline's voice shook the furniture.\n\n\"Amusing that the fellow should have handed me of all people a\nletter for Maud,\" explained her brother. \"I don't want to get Maud\ninto trouble.\"",
        "\"You are criminally weak,\" said Lady Caroline severely. \"I really\nhonestly believe that you were capable of giving the note to that\npoor, misguided girl, and saying nothing about it.\" She flushed.\n\"The insolence of the man, coming here and settling down at the\nvery gates of the castle! If it was anybody but this man Platt who\nwas giving him shelter I should insist on his being turned out. But\nthat man Platt would be only too glad to know that he is causing us\nannoyance.\"",
        "\"Quite!\" said Lord Belpher.\n\n\"You must go to this man as soon as possible,\" continued Lady\nCaroline, fixing her brother with a commanding stare, \"and do your\nbest to make him see how abominable his behaviour is.\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't!\" pleaded the earl. \"I don't know the fellow. He'd\nthrow me out.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Go at the very earliest opportunity.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right, all right, all right. Well, I think I'll be\nslipping out to the rose garden again now. There's a clear hour\nbefore dinner.\"",
        "There was a tap at the door. Alice Faraday entered bearing papers,\na smile of sweet helpfulness on her pretty face.\n\n\"I hoped I should find you here, Lord Marshmoreton. You promised to\ngo over these notes with me, the ones about the Essex branch--\"\n\nThe hunted peer looked as if he were about to dive through the\nwindow.\n\n\"Some other time, some other time. I--I have important matters--\"\n\n\"Oh, if you're busy--\"\n\n\"Of course, Lord Marshmoreton will be delighted to work on your",
        "notes, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline crisply.  \"Take this\nchair. We are just going.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton gave one wistful glance through the open window.\nThen he sat down with a sigh, and felt for his reading-glasses.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10.\n\nYour true golfer is a man who, knowing that life is short and\nperfection hard to attain, neglects no opportunity of practising\nhis chosen sport, allowing neither wind nor weather nor any\nexternal influence to keep him from it. There is a story, with an",
        "excellent moral lesson, of a golfer whose wife had determined to\nleave him for ever. \"Will nothing alter your decision?\" he says.\n\"Will nothing induce you to stay? Well, then, while you're packing,\nI think I'll go out on the lawn and rub up my putting a bit.\"\nGeorge Bevan was of this turn of mind. He might be in love; romance\nmight have sealed him for her own; but that was no reason for\nblinding himself to the fact that his long game was bound to suffer",
        "if he neglected to keep himself up to the mark. His first act on\narriving at Belpher village had been to ascertain whether there was\na links in the neighbourhood; and thither, on the morning after his\nvisit to the castle and the delivery of the two notes, he repaired.\n\nAt the hour of the day which he had selected the club-house was\nempty, and he had just resigned himself to a solitary game, when,\nwith a whirr and a rattle, a grey racing-car drove up, and from it",
        "emerged the same long young man whom, a couple of days earlier, he\nhad seen wriggle out from underneath the same machine. It was\nReggie Byng's habit also not to allow anything, even love, to\ninterfere with golf; and not even the prospect of hanging about the\ncastle grounds in the hope of catching a glimpse of Alice Faraday\nand exchanging timorous words with her had been enough to keep him\nfrom the links.\n\nReggie surveyed George with a friendly eye. He had a dim",
        "recollection of having seen him before somewhere at some time or\nother, and Reggie had the pleasing disposition which caused him to\nrank anybody whom he had seen somewhere at some time or other as a\nbosom friend.\n\n\"Hullo! Hullo! Hullo!\" he observed.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said George.\n\n\"Waiting for somebody?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How about it, then? Shall we stagger forth?\"\n\n\"Delighted.\"\n\nGeorge found himself speculating upon Reggie. He was unable to",
        "place him. That he was a friend of Maud he knew, and guessed that\nhe was also a resident of the castle. He would have liked to\nquestion Reggie, to probe him, to collect from him inside\ninformation as to the progress of events within the castle walls;\nbut it is a peculiarity of golf, as of love, that it temporarily\nchanges the natures of its victims; and Reggie, a confirmed babbler\noff the links, became while in action a stern, silent, intent",
        "person, his whole being centred on the game. With the exception of\na casual remark of a technical nature when he met George on the\nvarious tees, and an occasional expletive when things went wrong\nwith his ball, he eschewed conversation. It was not till the end of\nthe round that he became himself again.\n\n\"If I'd known you were such hot stuff,\" he declared generously, as\nGeorge holed his eighteenth putt from a distance of ten feet, \"I'd\nhave got you to give me a stroke or two.\"",
        "\"I was on my game today,\" said George modestly. \"Sometimes I slice\nas if I were cutting bread and can't putt to hit a haystack.\"\n\n\"Let me know when one of those times comes along, and I'll take you\non again. I don't know when I've seen anything fruitier than the\nway you got out of the bunker at the fifteenth. It reminded me of\na match I saw between--\" Reggie became technical. At the end of his\nobservations he climbed into the grey car.\n\n\"Can I drop you anywhere?\"",
        "\"Thanks,\" said George. \"If it's not taking you out your way.\"\n\n\"I'm staying at Belpher Castle.\"\n\n\"I live quite near there. Perhaps you'd care to come in and have a\ndrink on your way?\"\n\n\"A ripe scheme,\" agreed Reggie\n\nTen minutes in the grey car ate up the distance between the links\nand George's cottage. Reggie Byng passed these minutes, in the\nintervals of eluding carts and foiling the apparently suicidal\nintentions of some stray fowls, in jerky conversation on the",
        "subject of his iron-shots, with which he expressed a deep\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Topping little place! Absolutely!\" was the verdict he pronounced\non the exterior of the cottage as he followed George in. \"I've\noften thought it would be a rather sound scheme to settle down in\nthis sort of shanty and keep chickens and grow a honey coloured\nbeard, and have soup and jelly brought to you by the vicar's wife\nand so forth. Nothing to worry you then. Do you live all alone\nhere?\"",
        "George was busy squirting seltzer into his guest's glass.\n\n\"Yes. Mrs. Platt comes in and cooks for me. The farmer's wife next\ndoor.\"\n\nAn exclamation from the other caused him to look up. Reggie Byng\nwas staring at him, wide-eyed.\n\n\"Great Scott! Mrs. Platt! Then you're the Chappie?\"\n\nGeorge found himself unequal to the intellectual pressure of the\nconversation.\n\n\"The Chappie?\"\n\n\"The Chappie there's all the row about. The mater was telling me\nonly this morning that you lived here.\"",
        "\"Is there a row about me?\"\n\n\"Is there what!\" Reggie's manner became solicitous. \"I say, my dear\nold sportsman, I don't want to be the bearer of bad tidings and\nwhat not, if you know what I mean, but didn't you know there was a\ncertain amount of angry passion rising and so forth because of you?\nAt the castle, I mean. I don't want to seem to be discussing your\nprivate affairs, and all that sort of thing, but what I mean is...\nWell, you don't expect you can come charging in the way you have",
        "without touching the family on the raw a bit. The daughter of the\nhouse falls in love with you; the son of the house languishes in\nchokey because he has a row with you in Piccadilly; and on top of\nall that you come here and camp out at the castle gates! Naturally\nthe family are a bit peeved. Only natural, eh? I mean to say,\nwhat?\"\n\nGeorge listened to this address in bewilderment. Maud in love with\nhim! It sounded incredible. That he should love her after their one",
        "meeting was a different thing altogether. That was perfectly\nnatural and in order. But that he should have had the incredible\nluck to win her affection. The thing struck him as grotesque and\nridiculous.\n\n\"In love with me?\" he cried. \"What on earth do you mean?\"\n\nReggie's bewilderment equalled his own.\n\n\"Well, dash it all, old top, it surely isn't news to you? She must\nhave told you. Why, she told me!\"\n\n\"Told you? Am I going mad?\"\n\n\"Absolutely! I mean absolutely not! Look here.\" Reggie hesitated.",
        "The subject was delicate. But, once started, it might as well be\nproceeded with to some conclusion. A fellow couldn't go on talking\nabout his iron-shots after this just as if nothing had happened.\nThis was the time for the laying down of cards, the opening of\nhearts. \"I say, you know,\" he went on, feeling his way, \"you'll\nprobably think it deuced rummy of me talking like this. Perfect\nstranger and what not. Don't even know each other's names.\"\n\n\"Mine's Bevan, if that'll be any help.\"",
        "\"Thanks very much, old chap. Great help! Mine's Byng. Reggie Byng.\nWell, as we're all pals here and the meeting's tiled and so forth,\nI'll start by saying that the mater is most deucedly set on my\nmarrying Lady Maud. Been pals all our lives, you know. Children\ntogether, and all that sort of rot. Now there's nobody I think a\nmore corking sportsman than Maud, if you know what I mean,\nbut--this is where the catch comes in--I'm most frightfully in love",
        "with somebody else. Hopeless, and all that sort of thing, but\nstill there it is. And all the while the mater behind me with a\nbradawl, sicking me on to propose to Maud who wouldn't have me if I\nwere the only fellow on earth. You can't imagine, my dear old chap,\nwhat a relief it was to both of us when she told me the other day\nthat she was in love with you, and wouldn't dream of looking at\nanybody else. I tell you, I went singing about the place.\"",
        "George felt inclined to imitate his excellent example. A burst of\nsong was the only adequate expression of the mood of heavenly\nhappiness which this young man's revelations had brought upon him.\nThe whole world seemed different. Wings seemed to sprout from\nReggie's shapely shoulders. The air was filled with soft music.\nEven the wallpaper seemed moderately attractive.\n\nHe mixed himself a second whisky and soda. It was the next best\nthing to singing.",
        "\"I see,\" he said. It was difficult to say anything. Reggie was\nregarding him enviously.\n\n\"I wish I knew how the deuce fellows set about making a girl fall\nin love with them. Other chappies seem to do it, but I can't even\nstart. She seems to sort of gaze through me, don't you know. She\nkind of looks at me as if I were more to be pitied than censured,\nbut as if she thought I really ought to do something about it. Of\ncourse, she's a devilish brainy girl, and I'm a fearful chump.",
        "Makes it kind of hopeless, what?\"\n\nGeorge, in his new-born happiness, found a pleasure in encouraging\na less lucky mortal.\n\n\"Not a bit. What you ought to do is to--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Reggie eagerly.\n\nGeorge shook his head.\n\n\"No, I don't know,\" he said.\n\n\"Nor do I, dash it!\" said Reggie.\n\nGeorge pondered.\n\n\"It seems to me it's purely a question of luck. Either you're lucky\nor you're not. Look at me, for instance. What is there about me to\nmake a wonderful girl love me?\"",
        "\"Nothing! I see what you mean. At least, what I mean to say is--\"\n\n\"No. You were right the first time. It's all a question of luck.\nThere's nothing anyone can do.\"\n\n\"I hang about a good deal and get in her way,\" said Reggie.  \"She's\nalways tripping over me. I thought that might help a bit.\"\n\n\"It might, of course.\"\n\n\"But on the other hand, when we do meet, I can't think of anything\nto say.\"\n\n\"That's bad.\"\n\n\"Deuced funny thing. I'm not what you'd call a silent sort of",
        "chappie by nature. But, when I'm with her--I don't know. It's\nrum!\" He drained his glass and rose. \"Well, I suppose I may as well\nbe staggering. Don't get up. Have another game one of these days,\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Splendid. Any time you like.\"\n\n\"Well, so long.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nGeorge gave himself up to glowing thoughts. For the first time in\nhis life he seemed to be vividly aware of his own existence. It\nwas as if he were some newly-created thing. Everything around him",
        "and everything he did had taken on a strange and novel interest. He\nseemed to notice the ticking of the clock for the first time. When\nhe raised his glass the action had a curious air of newness. All\nhis senses were oddly alert. He could even--\n\n\"How would it be,\" enquired Reggie, appearing in the doorway like\npart of a conjuring trick, \"if I gave her a flower or two every now\nand then? Just thought of it as I was starting the car. She's fond\nof flowers.\"",
        "\"Fine!\" said George heartily. He had not heard a word. The\nalertness of sense which had come to him was accompanied by a\nstrange inability to attend to other people's speech. This would no\ndoubt pass, but meanwhile it made him a poor listener.\n\n\"Well, it's worth trying,\" said Reggie. \"I'll give it a whirl.\nToodleoo!\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Pip-pip!\"\n\nReggie withdrew, and presently came the noise of the car starting.\nGeorge returned to his thoughts.",
        "Time, as we understand it, ceases to exist for a man in such\ncircumstances. Whether it was a minute later or several hours,\nGeorge did not know; but presently he was aware of a small boy\nstanding beside him--a golden-haired boy with blue eyes, who wore\nthe uniform of a page. He came out of his trance. This, he\nrecognized, was the boy to whom he had given the note for Maud. He\nwas different from any other intruder. He meant something in\nGeorge's scheme of things.\n\n\"'Ullo!\" said the youth.",
        "\"Hullo, Alphonso!\" said George.\n\n\"My name's not Alphonso.\"\n\n\"Well, you be very careful or it soon may be.\"\n\n\"Got a note for yer. From Lidy Mord.\"\n\n\"You'll find some cake and ginger-ale in the kitchen,\" said the\ngrateful George. \"Give it a trial.\"\n\n\"Not 'arf!\" said the stripling.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11.\n\nGeorge opened the letter with trembling and reverent fingers.\n\n\n    \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,\n\n      \"Thank you ever so much for your note, which Albert gave\n    to me. How very, very kind. . .\"\n\n\n\"Hey, mister!\"",
        "George looked up testily. The boy Albert had reappeared.\n\n\"What's the matter? Can't you find the cake?\"\n\n\"I've found the kike,\" rejoined Albert, adducing proof of the\nstatement in the shape of a massive slice, from which he took a\nsubstantial bite to assist thought. \"But I can't find the ginger\nile.\"\n\nGeorge waved him away. This interruption at such a moment was\nannoying.\n\n\"Look for it, child, look for it! Sniff after it! Bay on its trail!\nIt's somewhere about.\"",
        "\"Wri'!\" mumbled Albert through the cake. He flicked a crumb off his\ncheek with a tongue which would have excited the friendly interest\nof an ant-eater. \"I like ginger-ile.\"\n\n\"Well, go and bathe in it.\"\n\n\"Wri'!\"\n\nGeorge returned to his letter.\n\n    \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,\n\n      \"Thank you ever so much for your note, which Albert gave\n    to me. How very, very kind of you to come here like this and\n    to say . . .\n\n\"Hey, mister!\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" George glared. \"What's the matter now?  Haven't you",
        "found that ginger-ale yet?\"\n\n\"I've found the ginger-ile right enough, but I can't find the\nthing.\"\n\n\"The thing? What thing?\"\n\n\"The thing. The thing wot you open ginger-ile with.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean the thing? It's in the middle drawer of the dresser.\nUse your eyes, my boy!\"\n\n\"Wri'\".\n\nGeorge gave an overwrought sigh and began the letter again.\n\n    \"DEAR MR.

        "to say that you would help me. And how clever of you to\n    find me after I was so secretive that day in the cab!  You\n    really can help me, if you are willing. It's too long to\n    explain in a note, but I am in great trouble, and there is\n    nobody except you to help me. I will explain everything\n    when I see you. The difficulty will be to slip away from\n    home. They are watching me every moment, I'm afraid. But I\n    will try my hardest to see you very soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,\n                       \"MAUD MARSH.\"\n\nJust for a moment it must be confessed, the tone of the letter\ndamped George. He could not have said just what he had expected,\nbut certainly Reggie's revelations had prepared him for something\nrather warmer, something more in the style in which a girl would\nwrite to the man she loved. The next moment, however, he saw how\nfoolish any such expectation had been. How on earth could any",
        "reasonable man expect a girl to let herself go at this stage of the\nproceedings? It was for him to make the first move. Naturally she\nwasn't going to reveal her feelings until he had revealed his.\n\nGeorge raised the letter to his lips and kissed it vigorously.\n\n\"Hey, mister!\"\n\nGeorge started guiltily. The blush of shame overspread his cheeks.\nThe room seemed to echo with the sound of that fatuous kiss.\n\n\"Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!\" he called, snapping his fingers, and",
        "repeating the incriminating noise. \"I was just calling my cat,\" he\nexplained with dignity. \"You didn't see her in there, did you?\"\n\nAlbert's blue eyes met his in a derisive stare. The lid of the left\none fluttered. It was but too plain that Albert was not convinced.\n\n\"A little black cat with white shirt-front,\" babbled George\nperseveringly. \"She's usually either here or there, or--or\nsomewhere. Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!\"\n\nThe cupid's bow of Albert's mouth parted. He uttered one word.\n\n\"Swank!\"",
        "There was a tense silence. What Albert was thinking one cannot say.\nThe thoughts of Youth are long, long thoughts. What George was\nthinking was that the late King Herod had been unjustly blamed for\na policy which had been both statesmanlike and in the interests of\nthe public. He was blaming the mawkish sentimentality of the modern\nlegal system which ranks the evisceration and secret burial of\nsmall boys as a crime.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean.\"\n\n\"I've a good mind to--\"",
        "Albert waved a deprecating hand.\n\n\"It's all right, mister. I'm yer friend.\"\n\n\"You are, are you? Well, don't let it about. I've got a reputation\nto keep up.\"\n\n\"I'm yer friend, I tell you. I can help yer. I want to help yer!\"\n\nGeorge's views on infanticide underwent a slight modification.\nAfter all, he felt, much must be excused to Youth. Youth thinks it\nfunny to see a man kissing a letter. It is not funny, of course; it\nis beautiful; but it's no good arguing the point. Let Youth have",
        "its snigger, provided, after it has finished sniggering, it intends\nto buckle to and be of practical assistance. Albert, as an ally,\nwas not to be despised. George did not know what Albert's duties as\na page-boy were, but they seemed to be of a nature that gave him\nplenty of leisure and freedom; and a friendly resident of the\ncastle with leisure and freedom was just what he needed.\n\n\"That's very good of you,\" he said, twisting his reluctant\nfeatures into a fairly benevolent smile.",
        "\"I can 'elp!\" persisted Albert. \"Got a cigaroot?\"\n\n\"Do you smoke, child?\"\n\n\"When I get 'old of a cigaroot I do.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't oblige you. I don't smoke cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Then I'll 'ave to 'ave one of my own,\" said Albert moodily.\n\nHe reached into the mysteries of his pocket and produced a piece of\nstring, a knife, the wishbone of a fowl, two marbles, a crushed\ncigarette, and a match. Replacing the string, the knife, the\nwishbone and the marbles, he ignited the match against the tightest",
        "part of his person and lit the cigarette.\n\n\"I can help yer. I know the ropes.\"\n\n\"And smoke them,\" said George, wincing.\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nAlbert took an enjoyable whiff.\n\n\"I know all about yer.\"\n\n\"You do?\"\n\n\"You and Lidy Mord.\"\n\n\"Oh, you do, do you?\"\n\n\"I was listening at the key-'ole while the row was goin' on.\"\n\n\"There was a row, was there?\"\n\nA faint smile of retrospective enjoyment lit up Albert's face. \"An\norful row! Shoutin' and yellin' and cussin' all over the shop.",
        "About you and Lidy Maud.\"\n\n\"And you drank it in, eh?\"\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"I say, you listened?\"\n\n\"Not 'arf I listened. Seeing I'd just drawn you in the sweepstike,\nof course, I listened--not 'arf!\"\n\nGeorge did not follow him here.\n\n\"The sweepstike? What's a sweepstike?\"\n\n\"Why, a thing you puts names in 'ats and draw 'em and the\none that gets the winning name wins the money.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean a sweepstake!\"\n\n\"That's wot I said--a sweepstike.\"\n\nGeorge was still puzzled.",
        "\"But I don't understand. How do you mean you drew me in a\nsweepstike--I mean a sweepstake? What sweepstake?\"\n\n\"Down in the servants' 'all. Keggs, the butler, started it. I\n'eard 'im say he always 'ad one every place 'e was in as a butler--\nleastways, whenever there was any dorters of the 'ouse. There's\nalways a chance, when there's a 'ouse-party, of one of the dorters\nof the 'ouse gettin' married to one of the gents in the party, so",
        "Keggs 'e puts all of the gents' names in an 'at, and you pay five\nshillings for a chance, and the one that draws the winning name\ngets the money. And if the dorter of the 'ouse don't get married\nthat time, the money's put away and added to the pool for the next\n'ouse-party.\"\n\nGeorge gasped. This revelation of life below stairs in the stately\nhomes of England took his breath away. Then astonishment gave way to\nindignation.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you--you worms--made Lady Maud",
        "the--the prize of a sweepstake!\"\n\nAlbert was hurt.\n\n\"Who're yer calling worms?\"\n\nGeorge perceived the need of diplomacy. After all much depended on\nthis child's goodwill.\n\n\"I was referring to the butler--what's his name--Keggs.\"\n\n\"'E ain't a worm. 'E's a serpint.\" Albert drew at his cigarette.\nHis brow darkened. \"'E does the drawing, Keggs does, and I'd like\nto know 'ow it is 'e always manages to cop the fav'rit!\"\n\nAlbert chuckled.",
        "\"But this time I done him proper. 'E didn't want me in the thing at\nall. Said I was too young. Tried to do the drawin' without me.\n'Clip that boy one side of the 'ead!' 'e says, 'and turn 'im out!'\n'e says. I says, 'Yus, you will!' I says. 'And wot price me goin'\nto 'is lordship and blowing the gaff?' I says. 'E says, 'Oh, orl\nright!' 'e says. 'Ave it yer own way!' 'e says.\n\n\"'Where's yer five shillings?' 'e says. ''Ere yer are!' I says.",
        "'Oh, very well,' 'e says. 'But you'll 'ave to draw last,' 'e says,\n'bein' the youngest.' Well, they started drawing the names,\nand of course Keggs 'as to draw Mr. Byng.\"\n\n\"Oh, he drew Mr. Byng, did he?\"\n\n\"Yus. And everyone knew Reggie was the fav'rit. Smiled all over his\nfat face, the old serpint did! And when it come to my turn, 'e says\nto me, 'Sorry, Elbert!' 'e says, 'but there ain't no more names.\nThey've give out!' 'Oh, they 'ave, 'ave they?' I says, 'Well, wot's",
        "the matter with giving a fellow a sporting chance?' I says. 'Ow do\nyou mean?' 'e says. 'Why, write me out a ticket marked \"Mr. X.\",' I\nsays. 'Then, if 'er lidyship marries anyone not in the 'ouse-party,\nI cop!' 'Orl right,' 'e says, 'but you know the conditions of this\n'ere sweep. Nothin' don't count only wot tikes plice during the two\nweeks of the 'ouse-party,' 'e says. 'Orl right,' I says. 'Write me\nticket. It's a fair sportin' venture.' So 'e writes me out me",
        "ticket, with 'Mr. X.' on it, and I says to them all, I says, 'I'd\nlike to 'ave witnesses', I says, 'to this 'ere thing. Do all you\ngents agree that if anyone not in the 'ouse-party and 'oo's name\nain't on one of the other tickets marries 'er lidyship, I get the\npool?' I says. They all says that's right, and then I says to 'em\nall straight out, I says, 'I 'appen to know', I says, 'that 'er\nlidyship is in love with a gent that's not in the party at all. An",
        "American gent,' I says. They wouldn't believe it at first, but,\nwhen Keggs 'ad put two and two together, and thought of one or two\nthings that 'ad 'appened, 'e turned as white as a sheet and said it\nwas a swindle and wanted the drawin' done over again, but the\nothers says 'No', they says, 'it's quite fair,' they says, and one\nof 'em offered me ten bob slap out for my ticket. But I stuck to\nit, I did. And that,\" concluded Albert throwing the cigarette into",
        "the fire-place just in time to prevent a scorched finger, \"that's\nwhy I'm going to 'elp yer!\"\n\nThere is probably no attitude of mind harder for the average man to\nmaintain than that of aloof disapproval. George was an average man,\nand during the degrading recital just concluded he had found\nhimself slipping. At first he had been revolted, then, in spite of\nhimself, amused, and now, when all the facts were before him, he\ncould induce his mind to think of nothing else than his good",
        "fortune in securing as an ally one who appeared to combine a\nprecocious intelligence with a helpful lack of scruple. War is war,\nand love is love, and in each the practical man inclines to demand\nfrom his fellow-workers the punch rather than a lofty soul. A page\nboy replete with the finer feelings would have been useless in this\ncrisis. Albert, who seemed, on the evidence of a short but\nsufficient acquaintance, to be a lad who would not recognize the",
        "finer feelings if they were handed to him on a plate with\nwatercress round them, promised to be invaluable. Something in his\nmanner told George that the child was bursting with schemes for his\nbenefit.\n\n\"Have some more cake, Albert,\" he said ingratiatingly.\n\nThe boy shook his head.\n\n\"Do,\" urged George. \"Just a little slice.\"\n\n\"There ain't no little slice,\" replied Albert with regret.\n\"I've ate it all.\" He sighed and resumed. \"I gotta scheme!\"\n\n\"Fine! What is it?\"\n\nAlbert knitted his brows.",
        "\"It's like this. You want to see 'er lidyship, but you can't come\nto the castle, and she can't come to you--not with 'er fat brother\ndogging of 'er footsteps. That's it, ain't it? Or am I a liar?\"\n\nGeorge hastened to reassure him.\n\n\"That is exactly it. What's the answer?\"\n\n\"I'll tell yer wot you can do. There's the big ball tonight 'cos of\nits bein' 'Is Nibs' comin'-of-age tomorrow. All the county'll be\n'ere.\"\n\n\"You think I could slip in and be taken for a guest?\"\n\nAlbert snorted contempt.",
        "\"No, I don't think nothin' of the kind, not bein' a fat-head.\"\nGeorge apologized. \"But wot you could do's this. I 'eard Keggs\ntorkin to the 'ouse-keeper about 'avin' to get in a lot of temp'y\nwaiters to 'elp out for the night--\"\n\nGeorge reached forward and patted Albert on the head.\n\n\"Don't mess my 'air, now,\" warned that youth coldly.\n\n\"Albert, you're one of the great thinkers of the age. I could get\ninto the castle as a waiter, and you could tell Lady Maud I was",
        "there, and we could arrange a meeting. Machiavelli couldn't have\nthought of anything smoother.\"\n\n\"Mac Who?\"\n\n\"One of your ancestors. Great schemer in his day. But, one moment.\"\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"How am I to get engaged? How do I get the job?\"\n\n\"That's orl right. I'll tell the 'ousekeeper you're my cousin--\nbeen a waiter in America at the best restaurongs--'ome for a\n'oliday, but'll come in for one night to oblige. They'll pay yer a\nquid.\"\n\n\"I'll hand it over to you.\"",
        "\"Just,\" said Albert approvingly, \"wot I was goin' to suggest\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Then I'll leave all the arrangements to you.\"\n\n\"You'd better, if you don't want to mike a mess of everything. All\nyou've got to do is to come to the servants' entrance at eight\nsharp tonight and say you're my cousin.\"\n\n\"That's an awful thing to ask anyone to say.\"\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" said George.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12.\n\nThe great ball in honour of Lord Belpher's coming-of-age was at its",
        "height. The reporter of the Belpher Intelligencer and Farmers'\nGuide, who was present in his official capacity, and had been\nallowed by butler Keggs to take a peep at the scene through a\nside-door, justly observed in his account of the proceedings next\nday that the 'tout ensemble was fairylike', and described the\ncompany as 'a galaxy of fair women and brave men'. The floor was\ncrowded with all that was best and noblest in the county; so that a",
        "half-brick, hurled at any given moment, must infallibly have spilt\nblue blood. Peers stepped on the toes of knights; honorables bumped\ninto the spines of baronets. Probably the only titled person in the\nwhole of the surrounding country who was not playing his part in\nthe glittering scene was Lord Marshmoreton; who, on discovering\nthat his private study had been converted into a cloakroom, had\nretired to bed with a pipe and a copy of Roses Red and Roses White,",
        "by Emily Ann Mackintosh (Popgood, Crooly & Co.), which he was to\ndiscover--after he was between the sheets, and it was too late to\nrepair the error--was not, as he had supposed, a treatise on his\nfavourite hobby, but a novel of stearine sentimentality dealing\nwith the adventures of a pure young English girl and an artist\nnamed Claude.\n\nGeorge, from the shaded seclusion of a gallery, looked down upon\nthe brilliant throng with impatience. It seemed to him that he had",
        "been doing this all his life. The novelty of the experience had\nlong since ceased to divert him. It was all just like the second\nact of an old-fashioned musical comedy (Act Two:  The Ballroom,\nGrantchester Towers: One Week Later)--a resemblance which was\nheightened for him by the fact that the band had more than once\nplayed dead and buried melodies of his own composition, of which he\nhad wearied a full eighteen months back.\n\nA complete absence of obstacles had attended his intrusion into the",
        "castle. A brief interview with a motherly old lady, whom even\nAlbert seemed to treat with respect, and who, it appeared was Mrs.\nDigby, the house-keeper; followed by an even briefer encounter with\nKeggs (fussy and irritable with responsibility, and, even while\ntalking to George carrying on two other conversations on topics of\nthe moment), and he was past the censors and free for one night\nonly to add his presence to the chosen inside the walls of Belpher.",
        "His duties were to stand in this gallery, and with the assistance\nof one of the maids to minister to the comfort of such of the\ndancers as should use it as a sitting-out place. None had so far\nmade their appearance, the superior attractions of the main floor\nhaving exercised a great appeal; and for the past hour George had\nbeen alone with the maid and his thoughts. The maid, having asked\nGeorge if he knew her cousin Frank, who had been in America nearly",
        "a year, and having received a reply in the negative, seemed to be\ndisappointed in him, and to lose interest, and had not spoken for\ntwenty minutes.\n\nGeorge scanned the approaches to the balcony for a sight of Albert\nas the shipwrecked mariner scans the horizon for the passing sail.\nIt was inevitable, he supposed, this waiting. It would be difficult\nfor Maud to slip away even for a moment on such a night.\n\n\"I say, laddie, would you mind getting me a lemonade?\"",
        "George was gazing over the balcony when the voice spoke behind him,\nand the muscles of his back stiffened as he recognized its genial\nnote. This was one of the things he had prepared himself for, but,\nnow that it had happened, he felt a wave of stage-fright such as he\nhad only once experienced before in his life--on the occasion when\nhe had been young enough and inexperienced enough to take a\ncurtain-call on a first night. Reggie Byng was friendly, and would",
        "not wilfully betray him; but Reggie was also a babbler, who could\nnot be trusted to keep things to himself. It was necessary, he\nperceived, to take a strong line from the start, and convince\nReggie that any likeness which the latter might suppose that he\ndetected between his companion of that afternoon and the waiter of\ntonight existed only in his heated imagination.\n\nAs George turned, Reggie's pleasant face, pink with healthful\nexercise and Lord Marshmoreton's finest Bollinger, lost most of its",
        "colour. His eyes and mouth opened wider. The fact is Reggie was\nshaken. All through the earlier part of the evening he had been\nsedulously priming himself with stimulants with a view to amassing\nenough nerve to propose to Alice Faraday: and, now that he had\ndrawn her away from the throng to this secluded nook and was about\nto put his fortune to the test, a horrible fear swept over him that\nhe had overdone it. He was having optical illusions.\n\n\"Good God!\"",
        "Reggie loosened his collar, and pulled himself together.\n\n\"Would you mind taking a glass of lemonade to the lady in blue\nsitting on the settee over there by the statue,\" he said carefully.\n\nHe brightened up a little.\n\n\"Pretty good that! Not absolutely a test sentence, perhaps, like\n'Truly rural' or 'The intricacies of the British Constitution'.\nBut nevertheless no mean feat.\"\n\n\"I say!\" he continued, after a pause.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"You haven't ever seen me before by any chance, if you know what I",
        "mean, have you?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"You haven't a brother, or anything of that shape or order, have\nyou, no?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I have often wished I had. I ought to have spoken to\nfather about it. Father could never deny me anything.\"\n\nReggie blinked. His misgiving returned. Either his ears, like his\neyes, were playing him tricks, or else this waiter-chappie was\ntalking pure drivel.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said, 'No, sir, I have no brother'.\"\n\n\"Didn't you say something else?\"",
        "\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nReggie's worst suspicions were confirmed.\n\n\"Good God!\" he muttered. \"Then I am!\"\n\nMiss Faraday, when he joined her on the settee, wanted an\nexplanation.\n\n\"What were you talking to that man about, Mr. Byng? You seemed to\nbe having a very interesting conversation.\"\n\n\"I was asking him if he had a brother.\"\n\nMiss Faraday glanced quickly at him. She had had a feeling for some\ntime during the evening that his manner had been strange.",
        "\"A brother? What made you ask him that?\"\n\n\"He--I mean--that is to say--what I mean is, he looked the sort of\nchap who might have a brother. Lots of those fellows have!\"\n\nAlice Faraday's face took on a motherly look. She was fonder of\nReggie than that love-sick youth supposed, and by sheer accident he\nhad stumbled on the right road to her consideration. Alice Faraday\nwas one of those girls whose dream it is to be a ministering angel",
        "to some chosen man, to be a good influence to him and raise him to\nan appreciation of nobler things. Hitherto, Reggie's personality\nhad seemed to her agreeable, but negative. A positive vice like\nover-indulgence in alcohol altered him completely. It gave him a\nsignificance.\n\n\"I told him to get you a lemonade,\" said Reggie. \"He seems to be\ntaking his time about it. Hi!\"\n\nGeorge approached deferentially.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Where's that lemonade?\"\n\n\"Lemonade, sir?\"",
        "\"Didn't I ask you to bring this lady a glass of lemonade?\"\n\n\"I did not understand you to do so, sir.\"\n\n\"But, Great Scott! What were we chatting about, then?\"\n\n\"You were telling me a diverting story about an Irishman who landed\nin New York looking for work, sir. You would like a glass of\nlemonade, sir? Very good, sir.\"\n\nAlice placed a hand gently on Reggie's arm.\n\n\"Don't you think you had better lie down for a little and rest, Mr.\nByng? I'm sure it would do you good.\"",
        "The solicitous note in her voice made Reggie quiver like a jelly.\nHe had never known her speak like that before. For a moment he was\ninclined to lay bare his soul; but his nerve was broken. He did not\nwant her to mistake the outpouring of a strong man's heart for the\nirresponsible ravings of a too hearty diner. It was one of Life's\nironies. Here he was for the first time all keyed up to go right\nahead, and he couldn't do it.\n\n\"It's the heat of the room,\" said Alice. \"Shall we go and sit",
        "outside on the terrace? Never mind about the lemonade. I'm not\nreally thirsty.\"\n\nReggie followed her like a lamb. The prospect of the cool night air\nwas grateful.\n\n\"That,\" murmured George, as he watched them depart, \"ought to hold\nyou for a while!\"\n\nHe perceived Albert hastening towards him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13.\n\nAlbert was in a hurry. He skimmed over the carpet like a\nwater-beetle.\n\n\"Quick!\" he said.\n\nHe cast a glance at the maid, George's co-worker. She was reading a\nnovelette with her back turned.",
        "\"Tell 'er you'll be back in five minutes,\" said Albert, jerking a\nthumb.\n\n\"Unnecessary. She won't notice my absence. Ever since she\ndiscovered that I had never met her cousin Frank in America, I have\nmeant nothing in her life.\"\n\n\"Then come on.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"I'll show you.\"\n\nThat it was not the nearest and most direct route which they took\nto the trysting-place George became aware after he had followed his\nyoung guide through doors and up stairs and down stairs and had at",
        "last come to a halt in a room to which the sound of the music\npenetrated but faintly. He recognized the room. He had been in it\nbefore. It was the same room where he and Billie Dore had listened\nto Keggs telling the story of Lord Leonard and his leap. That\nwindow there, he remembered now, opened on to the very balcony from\nwhich the historic Leonard had done his spectacular dive. That it\nshould be the scene of this other secret meeting struck George as",
        "appropriate. The coincidence appealed to him.\n\nAlbert vanished. George took a deep breath. Now that the moment had\narrived for which he had waited so long he was aware of a return of\nthat feeling of stage-fright which had come upon him when he heard\nReggie Byng's voice. This sort of thing, it must be remembered, was\nnot in George's usual line. His had been a quiet and uneventful\nlife, and the only exciting thing which, in his recollection, had",
        "ever happened to him previous to the dramatic entry of Lady Maud\ninto his taxi-cab that day in Piccadilly, had occurred at college\nnearly ten years before, when a festive room-mate--no doubt with the\nbest motives--had placed a Mexican horned toad in his bed on the\nnight of the Yale football game.\n\nA light footstep sounded outside, and the room whirled round George\nin a manner which, if it had happened to Reggie Byng, would have\ncaused that injudicious drinker to abandon the habits of a",
        "lifetime. When the furniture had returned to its place and the rug\nhad ceased to spin, Maud was standing before him.\n\nNothing is harder to remember than a once-seen face. It had caused\nGeorge a good deal of distress and inconvenience that, try as he\nmight, he could not conjure up anything more than a vague vision of\nwhat the only girl in the world really looked like. He had carried\naway with him from their meeting in the cab only a confused",
        "recollection of eyes that shone and a mouth that curved in a smile;\nand the brief moment in which he was able to refresh his memory,\nwhen he found her in the lane with Reggie Byng and the broken-down\ncar, had not been enough to add definiteness. The consequence was\nthat Maud came upon him now with the stunning effect of beauty seen\nfor the first time. He gasped. In that dazzling ball-dress, with\nthe flush of dancing on her cheeks and the light of dancing in her",
        "eyes, she was so much more wonderful than any picture of her which\nmemory had been able to produce for his inspection that it was as\nif he had never seen her before.\n\nEven her brother, Percy, a stern critic where his nearest and\ndearest were concerned, had admitted on meeting her in the\ndrawing-room before dinner that that particular dress suited Maud.\nIt was a shimmering dream-thing of rose-leaves and moon-beams. That,\nat least, was how it struck George; a dressmaker would have found a",
        "longer and less romantic description for it. But that does not\nmatter. Whoever wishes for a cold and technical catalogue of the\nstuffs which went to make up the picture that deprived George of\nspeech may consult the files of the Belpher Intelligencer and\nFarmers' Guide, and read the report of the editor's wife, who\n\"does\" the dresses for the Intelligencer under the pen-name of\n\"Birdie Bright-Eye\". As far as George was concerned, the thing was\nmade of rose-leaves and moon-beams.",
        "George, as I say, was deprived of speech. That any girl could\npossibly look so beautiful was enough to paralyse his faculties;\nbut that this ethereal being straight from Fairyland could have\nstooped to love him--him--an earthy brute who wore sock-suspenders\nand drank coffee for breakfast . . . that was what robbed George of\nthe power to articulate. He could do nothing but look at her.\n\nFrom the Hills of Fairyland soft music came. Or, if we must be\nexact, Maud spoke.",
        "\"I couldn't get away before!\" Then she stopped short and darted to\nthe door listening. \"Was that somebody coming?  I had to cut a\ndance with Mr. Plummer to get here, and I'm so afraid he may. . .\"\n\nHe had. A moment later it was only too evident that this was\nprecisely what Mr. Plummer had done. There was a footstep on the\nstairs, a heavy footstep this time, and from outside the voice of\nthe pursuer made itself heard.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, Lady Maud! I was looking for you. This is our\ndance.\"",
        "George did not know who Mr. Plummer was. He did not want to know.\nHis only thought regarding Mr. Plummer was a passionate realization\nof the superfluity of his existence. It is the presence on the\nglobe of these Plummers that delays the coming of the Millennium.\n\nHis stunned mind leaped into sudden activity. He must not be found\nhere, that was certain. Waiters who ramble at large about a feudal\ncastle and are discovered in conversation with the daughter of the",
        "house excite comment. And, conversely, daughters of the house who\ntalk in secluded rooms with waiters also find explanations\nnecessary. He must withdraw. He must withdraw quickly. And, as a\ngesture from Maud indicated, the withdrawal must be effected\nthrough the french window opening on the balcony. Estimating the\ndistance that separated him from the approaching Plummer at three\nstairs--the voice had come from below--and a landing, the space of",
        "time allotted to him by a hustling Fate for disappearing was some\nfour seconds. Inside two and half, the french window had opened\nand closed, and George was out under the stars, with the cool winds\nof the night playing on his heated forehead.\n\nHe had now time for meditation. There are few situations which\nprovide more scope for meditation than that of the man penned up on\na small balcony a considerable distance from the ground, with his",
        "only avenue of retreat cut off behind him. So George meditated.\nFirst, he mused on Plummer. He thought some hard thoughts about\nPlummer. Then he brooded on the unkindness of a fortune which had\ngranted him the opportunity of this meeting with Maud, only to\nsnatch it away almost before it had begun. He wondered how long the\nlate Lord Leonard had been permitted to talk on that occasion\nbefore he, too, had had to retire through these same windows. There",
        "was no doubt about one thing. Lovers who chose that room for their\ninterviews seemed to have very little luck.\n\nIt had not occurred to George at first that there could be any\nfurther disadvantage attached to his position other than the\nobvious drawbacks which had already come to his notice. He was now\nto perceive that he had been mistaken. A voice was speaking in the\nroom he had left, a plainly audible voice, deep and throaty; and\nwithin a minute George had become aware that he was to suffer the",
        "additional discomfort of being obliged to listen to a fellow\nman--one could call Plummer that by stretching the facts a\nlittle--proposing marriage. The gruesomeness of the situation became\nintensified. Of all moments when a man--and justice compelled George\nto admit that Plummer was technically human--of all moments when a\nman may by all the laws of decency demand to be alone without an\naudience of his own sex, the chiefest is the moment when he is",
        "asking a girl to marry him. George's was a sensitive nature, and he\nwrithed at the thought of playing the eavesdropper at such a time.\n\nHe looked frantically about him for a means of escape. Plummer had\nnow reached the stage of saying at great length that he was not\nworthy of Maud. He said it over and over, again in different ways.\nGeorge was in hearty agreement with him, but he did not want to\nhear it. He wanted to get away. But how?  Lord Leonard on a similar",
        "occasion had leaped. Some might argue therefore on the principle\nthat what man has done, man can do, that George should have\nimitated him. But men differ. There was a man attached to a circus\nwho used to dive off the roof of Madison Square Garden on to a\nsloping board, strike it with his chest, turn a couple of\nsomersaults, reach the ground, bow six times and go off to lunch.\nThat sort of thing is a gift. Some of us have it, some have not.",
        "George had not. Painful as it was to hear Plummer floundering\nthrough his proposal of marriage, instinct told him that it would\nbe far more painful to hurl himself out into mid-air on the\nsporting chance of having his downward progress arrested by the\nbranches of the big tree that had upheld Lord Leonard. No, there\nseemed nothing for it but to remain where he was.\n\nInside the room Plummer was now saying how much the marriage would\nplease his mother.\n\n\"Psst!\"",
        "George looked about him. It seemed to him that he had heard a\nvoice. He listened. No. Except for the barking of a distant dog,\nthe faint wailing of a waltz, the rustle of a roosting bird, and\nthe sound of Plummer saying that if her refusal was due to anything\nshe might have heard about that breach-of-promise case of his a\ncouple of years ago he would like to state that he was more sinned\nagainst than sinning and that the girl had absolutely misunderstood\nhim, all was still.\n\n\"Psst! Hey, mister!\"",
        "It was a voice. It came from above. Was it an angel's voice?  Not\naltogether. It was Albert's. The boy was leaning out of a window\nsome six feet higher up the castle wall. George, his eyes by now\ngrown used to the darkness, perceived that the stripling\ngesticulated as one having some message to impart. Then, glancing\nto one side, he saw what looked like some kind of a rope swayed\nagainst the wall. He reached for it. The thing was not a rope: it\nwas a knotted sheet.",
        "From above came Albert's hoarse whisper.\n\n\"Look alive!\"\n\nThis was precisely what George wanted to do for at least another\nfifty years or so; and it seemed to him as he stood there in the\nstarlight, gingerly fingering this flimsy linen thing, that if he\nwere to suspend his hundred and eighty pounds of bone and sinew at\nthe end of it over the black gulf outside the balcony he would look\nalive for about five seconds, and after that goodness only knew how",
        "he would look. He knew all about knotted sheets. He had read a\nhundred stories in which heroes, heroines, low comedy friends and\neven villains did all sorts of reckless things with their\nassistance. There was not much comfort to be derived from that. It\nwas one thing to read about people doing silly things like that,\nquite another to do them yourself. He gave Albert's sheet a\ntentative shake. In all his experience he thought he had never come",
        "across anything so supremely unstable. (One calls it Albert's sheet\nfor the sake of convenience. It was really Reggie Byng's sheet.\nAnd when Reggie got to his room in the small hours of the morning\nand found the thing a mass of knots he jumped to the conclusion--\nbeing a simple-hearted young man--that his bosom friend Jack Ferris,\nwho had come up from London to see Lord Belpher through the trying\nexperience of a coming-of-age party, had done it as a practical",
        "joke, and went and poured a jug of water over Jack's bed. That is\nLife. Just one long succession of misunderstandings and rash acts\nand what not. Absolutely!)\n\nAlbert was becoming impatient. He was in the position of a great\ngeneral who thinks out some wonderful piece of strategy and can't\nget his army to carry it out. Many boys, seeing Plummer enter the\nroom below and listening at the keyhole and realizing that George\nmust have hidden somewhere and deducing that he must be out on the",
        "balcony, would have been baffled as to how to proceed. Not so\nAlbert. To dash up to Reggie Byng's room and strip his sheet off\nthe bed and tie it to the bed-post and fashion a series of knots in\nit and lower it out of the window took Albert about three minutes.\nHis part in the business had been performed without a hitch. And\nnow George, who had nothing in the world to do but the childish\ntask of climbing up the sheet, was jeopardizing the success of the",
        "whole scheme by delay. Albert gave the sheet an irritable jerk.\n\nIt was the worst thing he could have done. George had almost made\nup his mind to take a chance when the sheet was snatched from his\ngrasp as if it had been some live thing deliberately eluding his\nclutch. The thought of what would have happened had this occurred\nwhen he was in mid-air caused him to break out in a cold\nperspiration. He retired a pace and perched himself on the rail of\nthe balcony.\n\n\"Psst!\" said Albert.",
        "\"It's no good saying, 'Psst!'\" rejoined George in an annoyed\nundertone. \"I could say 'Psst!' Any fool could say 'Psst!'\"\n\nAlbert, he considered, in leaning out of the window and saying\n\"Psst!\" was merely touching the fringe of the subject.\n\nIt is probable that he would have remained seated on the balcony\nrail regarding the sheet with cold aversion, indefinitely, had not\nhis hand been forced by the man Plummer. Plummer, during these last",
        "minutes, had shot his bolt. He had said everything that a man could\nsay, much of it twice over; and now he was through. All was ended.\nThe verdict was in. No wedding-bells for Plummer.\n\n\"I think,\" said Plummer gloomily, and the words smote on George's\near like a knell, \"I think I'd like a little air.\"\n\nGeorge leaped from his rail like a hunted grasshopper. If Plummer\nwas looking for air, it meant that he was going to come out on the",
        "balcony. There was only one thing to be done. It probably meant the\nabrupt conclusion of a promising career, but he could hesitate no\nlonger.\n\nGeorge grasped the sheet--it felt like a rope of cobwebs--and swung\nhimself out.\n\nMaud looked out on to the balcony. Her heart, which had stood still\nwhen the rejected one opened the window and stepped forth to commune\nwith the soothing stars, beat again. There was no one there, only\nemptiness and Plummer.",
        "\"This,\" said Plummer sombrely, gazing over the rail into the\ndarkness, \"is the place where that fellow what's-his-name jumped\noff in the reign of thingummy, isn't it?\"\n\nMaud understood now, and a thrill of the purest admiration for\nGeorge's heroism swept over her. So rather than compromise her, he\nhad done Leonard's leap! How splendid of him! If George, now sitting\non Reggie Byng's bed taking a rueful census of the bits of skin\nremaining on his hands and knees after his climb, could have read",
        "her thoughts, he would have felt well rewarded for his abrasions.\n\n\"I've a jolly good mind,\" said Plummer, \"to do it myself!\" He\nuttered a short, mirthless laugh. \"Well, anyway,\" he said\nrecklessly, \"I'll jolly well go downstairs and have a\nbrandy-and-soda!\"\n\nAlbert finished untying the sheet from the bedpost, and stuffed it\nunder the pillow.\n\n\"And now,\" said Albert, \"for a quiet smoke in the scullery.\"\n\nThese massive minds require their moments of relaxation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14.",
        "George's idea was to get home. Quick. There was no possible chance\nof a second meeting with Maud that night. They had met and had\nbeen whirled asunder. No use to struggle with Fate. Best to give in\nand hope that another time Fate would be kinder. What George wanted\nnow was to be away from all the gay glitter and the fairylike tout\nensemble and the galaxy of fair women and brave men, safe in his\nown easy-chair, where nothing could happen to him. A nice sense of",
        "duty would no doubt have taken him back to his post in order fully\nto earn the sovereign which had been paid to him for his services\nas temporary waiter; but the voice of Duty called to him in vain.\nIf the British aristocracy desired refreshments let them get them\nfor themselves--and like it! He was through.\n\nBut if George had for the time being done with the British\naristocracy, the British aristocracy had not done with him. Hardly",
        "had he reached the hall when he encountered the one member of the\norder whom he would most gladly have avoided.\n\nLord Belpher was not in genial mood. Late hours always made his\nhead ache, and he was not a dancing man; so that he was by now\nfully as weary of the fairylike tout ensemble as was George. But,\nbeing the centre and cause of the night's proceedings, he was\ncompelled to be present to the finish. He was in the position of\ncaptains who must be last to leave their ships, and of boys who",
        "stand on burning decks whence all but they had fled. He had spent\nseveral hours shaking hands with total strangers and receiving with\na frozen smile their felicitations on the attainment of his\nmajority, and he could not have been called upon to meet a larger\nhorde of relations than had surged round him that night if he had\nbeen a rabbit. The Belpher connection was wide, straggling over\nmost of England; and first cousins, second cousins and even third",
        "and fourth cousins had debouched from practically every county on\nthe map and marched upon the home of their ancestors. The effort of\nhaving to be civil to all of these had told upon Percy. Like the\nheroine of his sister Maud's favourite poem he was \"aweary,\naweary,\" and he wanted a drink. He regarded George's appearance as\nexceedingly opportune.\n\n\"Get me a small bottle of champagne, and bring it to the library.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe two words sound innocent enough, but, wishing as he did to",
        "efface himself and avoid publicity, they were the most unfortunate\nwhich George could have chosen. If he had merely bowed acquiescence\nand departed, it is probable that Lord Belpher would not have taken\na second look at him. Percy was in no condition to subject everyone\nhe met to a minute scrutiny. But, when you have been addressed for\nan entire lifetime as \"your lordship\", it startles you when a\nwaiter calls you \"Sir\". Lord Belpher gave George a glance in which",
        "reproof and pain were nicely mingled emotions quickly supplanted by\namazement. A gurgle escaped him.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried as George turned away.\n\nPercy was rattled. The crisis found him in two minds. On the one\nhand, he would have been prepared to take oath that this man before\nhim was the man who had knocked off his hat in Piccadilly. The\nlikeness had struck him like a blow the moment he had taken a good\nlook at the fellow. On the other hand, there is nothing which is",
        "more likely to lead one astray than a resemblance. He had never\nforgotten the horror and humiliation of the occasion, which had\nhappened in his fourteenth year, when a motherly woman at\nPaddington Station had called him \"dearie\" and publicly embraced\nhim, on the erroneous supposition that he was her nephew, Philip.\nHe must proceed cautiously. A brawl with an innocent waiter, coming\non the heels of that infernal episode with the policeman, would",
        "give people the impression that assailing the lower orders had\nbecome a hobby of his.\n\n\"Sir?\" said George politely.\n\nHis brazen front shook Lord Belpher's confidence.\n\n\"I haven't seen you before here, have I?\" was all he could find\nto say.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied George smoothly. \"I am only temporarily attached\nto the castle staff.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"America, sir.\"\n\nLord Belpher started. \"America!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I am in England on a vacation. My cousin, Albert, is",
        "page boy at the castle, and he told me there were a few vacancies\nfor extra help tonight, so I applied and was given the job.\"\n\nLord Belpher frowned perplexedly. It all sounded entirely\nplausible. And, what was satisfactory, the statement could be\nchecked by application to Keggs, the butler. And yet there was a\nlingering doubt. However, there seemed nothing to be gained by\ncontinuing the conversation.\n\n\"I see,\" he said at last. \"Well, bring that champagne to the\nlibrary as quick as you can.\"",
        "\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nLord Belpher remained where he stood, brooding. Reason told him he\nought to be satisfied, but he was not satisfied. It would have been\ndifferent had he not known that this fellow with whom Maud had\nbecome entangled was in the neighbourhood. And if that scoundrel\nhad had the audacity to come and take a cottage at the castle\ngates, why not the audacity to invade the castle itself?\n\nThe appearance of one of the footmen, on his way through the hall",
        "with a tray, gave him the opportunity for further investigation.\n\n\"Send Keggs to me!\"\n\n\"Very good, your lordship.\"\n\nAn interval and the butler arrived. Unlike Lord Belpher late hours\nwere no hardship to Keggs. He was essentially a night-blooming\nflower. His brow was as free from wrinkles as his shirt-front. He\nbore himself with the conscious dignity of one who, while he would\nhave freely admitted he did not actually own the castle, was\nnevertheless aware that he was one of its most conspicuous",
        "ornaments.\n\n\"You wished to see me, your lordship?\"\n\n\"Yes. Keggs, there are a number of outside men helping here\ntonight, aren't there?\"\n\n\"Indubitably, your lordship. The unprecedented scale of the\nentertainment necessitated the engagement of a certain number of\nsupernumeraries,\" replied Keggs with an easy fluency which Reggie\nByng, now cooling his head on the lower terrace, would have\nbitterly envied. \"In the circumstances, such an arrangement was\ninevitable.\"",
        "\"You engaged all these men yourself?\"\n\n\"In a manner of speaking, your lordship, and for all practical\npurposes, yes. Mrs. Digby, the 'ouse-keeper conducted the actual\nnegotiations in many cases, but the arrangement was in no instance\nconsidered complete until I had passed each applicant.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything of an American who says he is the cousin of\nthe page-boy?\"\n\n\"The boy Albert did introduce a nominee whom he stated to be 'is",
        "cousin 'ome from New York on a visit and anxious to oblige. I trust\nhe 'as given no dissatisfaction, your lordship?  He seemed a\nrespectable young man.\"\n\n\"No, no, not at all. I merely wished to know if you knew him. One\ncan't be too careful.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, your lordship.\"\n\n\"That's all, then.\"\n\n\"Thank you, your lordship.\"\n\nLord Belpher was satisfied. He was also relieved. He felt that\nprudence and a steady head had kept him from making himself",
        "ridiculous. When George presently returned with the life-saving\nfluid, he thanked him and turned his thoughts to other things.\n\nBut, if the young master was satisfied, Keggs was not. Upon Keggs a\nbright light had shone. There were few men, he flattered himself,\nwho could more readily put two and two together and bring the sum\nto a correct answer. Keggs knew of the strange American gentleman\nwho had taken up his abode at the cottage down by Platt's farm. His",
        "looks, his habits, and his motives for coming there had formed food\nfor discussion throughout one meal in the servant's hall; a\nstranger whose abstention from brush and palette showed him to be\nno artist being an object of interest. And while the solution put\nforward by a romantic lady's-maid, a great reader of novelettes,\nthat the young man had come there to cure himself of some unhappy\npassion by communing with nature, had been scoffed at by the",
        "company, Keggs had not been so sure that there might not be\nsomething in it. Later events had deepened his suspicion, which\nnow, after this interview with Lord Belpher, had become certainty.\n\nThe extreme fishiness of Albert's sudden production of a cousin\nfrom America was so manifest that only his preoccupation at the\nmoment when he met the young man could have prevented him seeing it\nbefore. His knowledge of Albert told him that, if one so versed as",
        "that youth in the art of Swank had really possessed a cousin in\nAmerica, he would long ago have been boring the servants' hall with\nfictions about the man's wealth and importance. For Albert not to\nlie about a thing, practically proved that thing non-existent. Such\nwas the simple creed of Keggs.\n\nHe accosted a passing fellow-servitor.\n\n\"Seen young blighted Albert anywhere, Freddy?\"\n\nIt was in this shameful manner that that mastermind was habitually\nreferred to below stairs.",
        "\"Seen 'im going into the scullery not 'arf a minute ago,\" replied\nFreddy.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"So long,\" said Freddy.\n\n\"Be good!\" returned Keggs, whose mode of speech among those of his\nown world differed substantially from that which he considered it\nbecame him to employ when conversing with the titled.\n\nThe fall of great men is but too often due to the failure of their\nmiserable bodies to give the necessary support to their great\nbrains. There are some, for example, who say that Napoleon would",
        "have won the battle of Waterloo if he had not had dyspepsia. Not\notherwise was it with Albert on that present occasion. The arrival\nof Keggs found him at a disadvantage. He had been imprudent enough,\non leaving George, to endeavour to smoke a cigar, purloined from\nthe box which stood hospitably open on a table in the hall. But for\nthis, who knows with what cunning counter-attacks he might have\nfoiled the butler's onslaught?  As it was, the battle was a\nwalk-over for the enemy.",
        "\"I've been looking for you, young blighted Albert!\" said Keggs\ncoldly.\n\nAlbert turned a green but defiant face to the foe.\n\n\"Go and boil yer 'ead!\" he advised.\n\n\"Never mind about my 'ead. If I was to do my duty to you, I'd give\nyou a clip side of your 'ead, that's what I'd do.\"\n\n\"And then bury it in the woods,\" added Albert, wincing as the\nconsequences of his rash act swept through his small form like some\nnauseous tidal wave. He shut his eyes. It upset him to see Keggs",
        "shimmering like that. A shimmering butler is an awful sight.\n\nKeggs laughed a hard laugh. \"You and your cousins from America!\"\n\n\"What about my cousins from America?\"\n\n\"Yes, what about them? That's just what Lord Belpher and me have\nbeen asking ourselves.\"\n\n\"I don't know wot you're talking about.\"\n\n\"You soon will, young blighted Albert! Who sneaked that American\nfellow into the 'ouse to meet Lady Maud?\"\n\n\"I never!\"\n\n\"Think I didn't see through your little game? Why, I knew from the\nfirst.\"",
        "\"Yes, you did! Then why did you let him into the place?\"\n\nKeggs snorted triumphantly. \"There! You admit it! It was that\nfeller!\"\n\nToo late Albert saw his false move--a move which in a normal state\nof health, he would have scorned to make. Just as Napoleon, minus a\nstomach-ache, would have scorned the blunder that sent his\nCuirassiers plunging to destruction in the sunken road.\n\n\"I don't know what you're torkin' about,\" he said weakly.",
        "\"Well,\" said Keggs, \"I haven't time to stand 'ere chatting with\nyou. I must be going back to 'is lordship, to tell 'im of the\n'orrid trick you played on him.\"\n\nA second spasm shook Albert to the core of his being. The double\nassault was too much for him. Betrayed by the body, the spirit\nyielded.\n\n\"You wouldn't do that, Mr. Keggs!\"\n\nThere was a white flag in every syllable.\n\n\"I would if I did my duty.\"\n\n\"But you don't care about that,\" urged Albert ingratiatingly.",
        "\"I'll have to think it over,\" mused Keggs. \"I don't want to be 'ard\non a young boy.\" He struggled silently with himself.  \"Ruinin' 'is\nprospecks!\"\n\nAn inspiration seemed to come to him.\n\n\"All right, young blighted Albert,\" he said briskly. \"I'll go\nagainst my better nature this once and chance it. And now,\nyoung feller me lad, you just 'and over that ticket of yours! You\nknow what I'm alloodin' to! That ticket you 'ad at the sweep,\nthe one with 'Mr. X' on it.\"",
        "Albert's indomitable spirit triumphed for a moment over his\nstricken body.\n\n\"That's likely, ain't it!\"\n\nKeggs sighed--the sigh of a good man who has done his best to help\na fellow-being and has been baffled by the other's perversity.\n\n\"Just as you please,\" he said sorrowfully. \"But I did 'ope I\nshouldn't 'ave to go to 'is lordship and tell 'im 'ow you've\ndeceived him.\"\n\nAlbert capitulated. \"'Ere yer are!\" A piece of paper changed hands.",
        "\"It's men like you wot lead to 'arf the crime in the country!\"\n\n\"Much obliged, me lad.\"\n\n\"You'd walk a mile in the snow, you would,\" continued Albert\npursuing his train of thought, \"to rob a starving beggar of a\nha'penny.\"\n\n\"Who's robbing anyone? Don't you talk so quick, young man. I'm\ndoing the right thing by you. You can 'ave my ticket, marked\n'Reggie Byng'. It's a fair exchange, and no one the worse!\"\n\n\"Fat lot of good that is!\"\n\n\"That's as it may be. Anyhow, there it is.\" Keggs prepared to",
        "withdraw. \"You're too young to 'ave all that money, Albert. You\nwouldn't know what to do with it. It wouldn't make you 'appy.\nThere's other things in the world besides winning sweepstakes. And,\nproperly speaking, you ought never to have been allowed to draw at\nall, being so young.\"\n\nAlbert groaned hollowly. \"When you've finished torkin', I wish\nyou'd kindly have the goodness to leave me alone. I'm not meself.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Keggs cordially, \"is a bit of luck for you, my boy.",
        "Accept my 'eartiest felicitations!\"\n\nDefeat is the test of the great man. Your true general is not he\nwho rides to triumph on the tide of an easy victory, but the one\nwho, when crushed to earth, can bend himself to the task of\nplanning methods of rising again. Such a one was Albert, the\npage-boy. Observe Albert in his attic bedroom scarcely more than an\nhour later. His body has practically ceased to trouble him, and his\nsoaring spirit has come into its own again. With the exception of",
        "a now very occasional spasm, his physical anguish has passed, and\nhe is thinking, thinking hard. On the chest of drawers is a grubby\nenvelope, addressed in an ill-formed hand to:\n\n        R. Byng, Esq.\n\nOn a sheet of paper, soon to be placed in the envelope, are written\nin the same hand these words:\n\n\n      \"Do not dispare! Remember! Fante hart never won\n    fair lady. I shall watch your futur progres with\n    considurable interest.\n                    Your Well-Wisher.\"",
        "The last sentence is not original. Albert's Sunday-school teacher\nsaid it to Albert on the occasion of his taking up his duties at\nthe castle, and it stuck in his memory. Fortunately, for it\nexpressed exactly what Albert wished to say. From now on Reggie\nByng's progress with Lady Maud Marsh was to be the thing nearest to\nAlbert's heart.\n\nAnd George meanwhile? Little knowing how Fate has changed in a\nflash an ally into an opponent he is standing at the edge of the",
        "shrubbery near the castle gate. The night is very beautiful; the\nbarked spots on his hands and knees are hurting much less now; and\nhe is full of long, sweet thoughts. He has just discovered the\nextraordinary resemblance, which had not struck him as he was\nclimbing up the knotted sheet, between his own position and that of\nthe hero of Tennyson's Maud, a poem to which he has always been\nparticularly addicted--and never more so than during the days since",
        "he learned the name of the only possible girl. When he has not been\nplaying golf, Tennyson's Maud has been his constant companion.\n\n    \"Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls\n       Come hither, the dances are done,\n     In glass of satin and glimmer of pearls.\n       Queen lily and rose in one;\n     Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls\n       To the flowers, and be their sun.\"\n\nThe music from the ballroom flows out to him through the motionless",
        "air. The smell of sweet earth and growing things is everywhere.\n\n    \"Come into the garden, Maud,\n       For the black bat, night, hath flown,\n     Come into the garden, Maud,\n       I am here at the gate alone;\n     And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,\n       And the musk of the rose is blown.\"\n\n\nHe draws a deep breath, misled young man. The night is very\nbeautiful. It is near to the dawn now and in the bushes live things\nare beginning to stir and whisper.\n\n\"Maud!\"",
        "Surely she can hear him?\n\n\"Maud!\"\n\nThe silver stars looked down dispassionately. This sort of thing\nhad no novelty for them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15.\n\nLord Belpher's twenty-first birthday dawned brightly, heralded in\nby much twittering of sparrows in the ivy outside his bedroom. These\nPercy did not hear, for he was sound asleep and had had a late\nnight. The first sound that was able to penetrate his heavy slumber\nand rouse him to a realization that his birthday had arrived was",
        "the piercing cry of Reggie Byng on his way to the bath-room across\nthe corridor. It was Reggie's disturbing custom to urge himself on\nto a cold bath with encouraging yells; and the noise of this\nperformance, followed by violent splashing and a series of sharp\nhowls as the sponge played upon the Byng spine, made sleep an\nimpossibility within a radius of many yards. Percy sat up in bed,\nand cursed Reggie silently. He discovered that he had a headache.",
        "Presently the door flew open, and the vocalist entered in person,\nclad in a pink bathrobe and very tousled and rosy from the tub.\n\n\"Many happy returns of the day, Boots, old thing!\"\n\nReggie burst rollickingly into song.\n\n       \"I'm twenty-one today!\n        Twenty-one today!\n        I've got the key of the door!\n        Never been twenty-one before!\n        And father says I can do what I like!\n          So shout Hip-hip-hooray!\n        I'm a jolly good fellow,\n          Twenty-one today.\"",
        "Lord Belpher scowled morosely.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't make that infernal noise!\"\n\n\"What infernal noise?\"\n\n\"That singing!\"\n\n\"My God! This man has wounded me!\" said Reggie.\n\n\"I've a headache.\"\n\n\"I thought you would have, laddie, when I saw you getting away with\nthe liquid last night. An X-ray photograph of your liver would show\nsomething that looked like a crumpled oak-leaf studded with\nhob-nails. You ought to take more exercise, dear heart. Except for",
        "sloshing that policeman, you haven't done anything athletic for\nyears.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't harp on that affair!\"\n\nReggie sat down on the bed.\n\n\"Between ourselves, old man,\" he said confidentially, \"I also--I\nmyself--Reginald Byng, in person--was perhaps a shade polluted\nduring the evening. I give you my honest word that just after\ndinner I saw three versions of your uncle, the bishop, standing in\na row side by side. I tell you, laddie, that for a moment I thought",
        "I had strayed into a Bishop's Beano at Exeter Hall or the Athenaeum\nor wherever it is those chappies collect in gangs. Then the three\nbishops sort of congealed into one bishop, a trifle blurred about\nthe outlines, and I felt relieved.

        "with joie-de-vivre--have you ever happened to see things? What I\nmean to say is, I had a deuced odd experience last night. I could\nhave sworn that one of the waiter-chappies was that fellow who\nknocked off your hat in Piccadilly.\"\n\nLord Belpher, who had sunk back on to the pillows at Reggie's\nentrance and had been listening to his talk with only intermittent\nattention, shot up in bed.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Absolutely! My mistake, of course, but there it was. The fellow\nmight have been his double.\"",
        "\"But you've never seen the man.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I have. I forgot to tell you. I met him on the links\nyesterday. I'd gone out there alone, rather expecting to have a\nround with the pro., but, finding this lad there, I suggested that\nwe might go round together. We did eighteen holes, and he licked\nthe boots off me. Very hot stuff he was. And after the game he took\nme off to his cottage and gave me a drink. He lives at the cottage\nnext door to Platt's farm, so, you see, it was the identical",
        "chappie. We got extremely matey. Like brothers. Absolutely! So you\ncan understand what a shock it gave me when I found what I took to\nbe the same man serving bracers to the multitude the same evening.\nOne of those nasty jars that cause a fellow's head to swim a bit,\ndon't you know, and make him lose confidence in himself.\"\n\nLord Belpher did not reply. His brain was whirling. So he had been\nright after all!\n\n\"You know,\" pursued Reggie seriously, \"I think you are making the",

Nobody could\nhave got out of the bunker at the fifteenth hole better than he did.\nIf you'll take my advice, you'll conciliate the feller.

Besides, even\nleaving out of the question the fact that he can do things with a\nniblick that I didn't think anybody except the pro. could do, he's a",
        "corking good sort. A stout fellow in every respect. I took to the\nchappie. He's all right. Grab him, Boots, before he gets away.\nThat's my tip to you. You'll never regret it! From first to last\nthis lad didn't foozle a single drive, and his approach-putting has\nto be seen to be believed. Well, got to dress, I suppose. Mustn't\nwaste life's springtime sitting here talking to you. Toodle-oo,\nladdie! We shall meet anon!\"\n\nLord Belpher leaped from his bed. He was feeling worse than ever",
        "now, and a glance into the mirror told him that he looked rather\nworse than he felt. Late nights and insufficient sleep, added to\nthe need of a shave, always made him look like something that\nshould have been swept up and taken away to the ash-bin. And as for\nhis physical condition, talking to Reggie Byng never tended to make\nyou feel better when you had a headache. Reggie's manner was not\nsoothing, and on this particular morning his choice of a topic had",
        "been unusually irritating. Lord Belpher told himself that he could\nnot understand Reggie. He had never been able to make his mind\nquite clear as to the exact relations between the latter and his\nsister Maud, but he had always been under the impression that, if\nthey were not actually engaged, they were on the verge of becoming\nso; and it was maddening to have to listen to Reggie advocating the\nclaims of a rival as if he had no personal interest in the affair",
        "at all. Percy felt for his complaisant friend something of the\nannoyance which a householder feels for the watchdog whom he finds\nfraternizing with the burglar. Why, Reggie, more than anyone else,\nought to be foaming with rage at the insolence of this American\nfellow in coming down to Belpher and planting himself at the castle\ngates. Instead of which, on his own showing, he appeared to have\nadopted an attitude towards him which would have excited remark",
        "if adopted by David towards Jonathan. He seemed to spend all his\nspare time frolicking with the man on the golf-links and hobnobbing\nwith him in his house.\n\nLord Belpher was thoroughly upset. It was impossible to prove it or\nto do anything about it now, but he was convinced that the fellow\nhad wormed his way into the castle in the guise of a waiter. He had\nprobably met Maud and plotted further meetings with her. This thing\nwas becoming unendurable.",
        "One thing was certain. The family honour was in his hands.\nAnything that was to be done to keep Maud away from the intruder\nmust be done by himself. Reggie was hopeless: he was capable, as\nfar as Percy could see, of escorting Maud to the fellow's door in\nhis own car and leaving her on the threshold with his blessing. As\nfor Lord Marshmoreton, roses and the family history took up so much\nof his time that he could not be counted on for anything but moral",
        "support. He, Percy, must do the active work.\n\nHe had just come to this decision, when, approaching the window and\ngazing down into the grounds, he perceived his sister Maud walking\nrapidly--and, so it seemed to him, with a furtive air--down the\neast drive. And it was to the east that Platt's farm and the\ncottage next door to it lay.\n\nAt the moment of this discovery, Percy was in a costume ill adapted\nfor the taking of country walks. Reggie's remarks about his liver",
        "had struck home, and it had been his intention, by way of a\ncorrective to his headache and a general feeling of swollen\nill-health, to do a little work before his bath with a pair of\nIndian clubs. He had arrayed himself for this purpose in an old\nsweater, a pair of grey flannel trousers, and patent leather\nevening shoes. It was not the garb he would have chosen himself\nfor a ramble, but time was flying: even to put on a pair of boots",
        "is a matter of minutes: and in another moment or two Maud would be\nout of sight. Percy ran downstairs, snatched up a soft\nshooting-hat, which proved, too late, to belong to a person with a\nhead two sizes smaller than his own; and raced out into the\ngrounds. He was just in time to see Maud disappearing round the\ncorner of the drive.\n\nLord Belpher had never belonged to that virile class of the\ncommunity which considers running a pleasure and a pastime. At",
        "Oxford, on those occasions when the members of his college had\nturned out on raw afternoons to trot along the river-bank\nencouraging the college eight with yelling and the swinging of\npolice-rattles, Percy had always stayed prudently in his rooms with\ntea and buttered toast, thereby avoiding who knows what colds and\ncoughs. When he ran, he ran reluctantly and with a definite object\nin view, such as the catching of a train. He was consequently not",
        "in the best of condition, and the sharp sprint which was imperative\nat this juncture if he was to keep his sister in view left him\nspent and panting. But he had the reward of reaching the gates of\nthe drive not many seconds after Maud, and of seeing her\nwalking--more slowly now--down the road that led to Platt's. This\nconfirmation of his suspicions enabled him momentarily to forget\nthe blister which was forming on the heel of his left foot. He set\nout after her at a good pace.",
        "The road, after the habit of country roads, wound and twisted. The\nquarry was frequently out of sight. And Percy's anxiety was such\nthat, every time Maud vanished, he broke into a gallop. Another\nhundred yards, and the blister no longer consented to be ignored.\nIt cried for attention like a little child, and was rapidly\ninsinuating itself into a position in the scheme of things where it\nthreatened to become the centre of the world. By the time the third",
        "bend in the road was reached, it seemed to Percy that this blister\nhad become the one great Fact in an unreal nightmare-like universe.\nHe hobbled painfully: and when he stopped suddenly and darted back\ninto the shelter of the hedge his foot seemed aflame. The only\nreason why the blister on his left heel did not at this juncture\nattract his entire attention was that he had become aware that\nthere was another of equal proportions forming on his right heel.",
        "Percy had stopped and sought cover in the hedge because, as he\nrounded the bend in the road, he perceived, before he had time to\ncheck his gallop, that Maud had also stopped. She was standing in\nthe middle of the road, looking over her shoulder, not ten yards\naway. Had she seen him? It was a point that time alone could solve.\nNo! She walked on again. She had not seen him. Lord Belpher, by\nmeans of a notable triumph of mind over matter, forgot the blisters\nand hurried after her.",
        "They had now reached that point in the road where three choices\noffer themselves to the wayfarer. By going straight on he may win\nthrough to the village of Moresby-in-the-Vale, a charming little\nplace with a Norman church; by turning to the left he may visit the\nequally seductive hamlet of Little Weeting; by turning to the right\noff the main road and going down a leafy lane he may find himself\nat the door of Platt's farm. When Maud, reaching the cross-roads,",
        "suddenly swung down the one to the left, Lord Belpher was for the\nmoment completely baffled. Reason reasserted its way the next\nminute, telling him that this was but a ruse. Whether or no she had\ncaught sight of him, there was no doubt that Maud intended to shake\noff any possible pursuit by taking this speciously innocent turning\nand making a detour. She could have no possible motive in going to\nLittle Weeting. He had never been to Little Weeting in his life,",
        "and there was no reason to suppose that Maud had either.\n\nThe sign-post informed him--a statement strenuously denied by the\ntwin-blisters--that the distance to Little Weeting was one and a\nhalf miles. Lord Belpher's view of it was that it was nearer fifty.\nHe dragged himself along wearily. It was simpler now to keep Maud\nin sight, for the road ran straight: but, there being a catch in\neverything in this world, the process was also messier. In order",
        "to avoid being seen, it was necessary for Percy to leave the road\nand tramp along in the deep ditch which ran parallel to it. There\nis nothing half-hearted about these ditches which accompany English\ncountry roads. They know they are intended to be ditches, not mere\nfurrows, and they behave as such. The one that sheltered Lord\nBelpher was so deep that only his head and neck protruded above the\nlevel of the road, and so dirty that a bare twenty yards of travel",
        "was sufficient to coat him with mud. Rain, once fallen, is\nreluctant to leave the English ditch. It nestles inside it for\nweeks, forming a rich, oatmeal-like substance which has to be\nstirred to be believed. Percy stirred it. He churned it. He\nploughed and sloshed through it. The mud stuck to him like a\nbrother.\n\nNevertheless, being a determined young man, he did not give in.\nOnce he lost a shoe, but a little searching recovered that. On",
        "another occasion, a passing dog, seeing things going on in the\nditch which in his opinion should not have been going on--he was a\nhigh-strung dog, unused to coming upon heads moving along the road\nwithout bodies attached--accompanied Percy for over a quarter of a\nmile, causing him exquisite discomfort by making sudden runs at his\nface. A well-aimed stone settled this little misunderstanding, and\nPercy proceeded on his journey alone. He had Maud well in view",
        "when, to his surprise, she left the road and turned into the gate of\na house which stood not far from the church.\n\nLord Belpher regained the road, and remained there, a puzzled man.\nA dreadful thought came to him that he might have had all this\ntrouble and anguish for no reason. This house bore the unmistakable\nstamp of a vicarage. Maud could have no reason that was not\ninnocent for going there. Had he gone through all this, merely to",
        "see his sister paying a visit to a clergyman? Too late it occurred\nto him that she might quite easily be on visiting terms with the\nclergy of Little Weeting. He had forgotten that he had been away at\nOxford for many weeks, a period of time in which Maud, finding life\nin the country weigh upon her, might easily have interested herself\ncharitably in the life of this village. He paused irresolutely. He\nwas baffled.\n\nMaud, meanwhile, had rung the bell. Ever since, looking over her",
        "shoulder, she had perceived her brother Percy dodging about in the\nbackground, her active young mind had been busying itself with\nschemes for throwing him off the trail. She must see George that\nmorning. She could not wait another day before establishing\ncommunication between herself and Geoffrey. But it was not till she\nreached Little Weeting that there occurred to her any plan that\npromised success.\n\nA trim maid opened the door.\n\n\"Is the vicar in?\"\n\n\"No, miss. He went out half an hour back.\"",
        "Maud was as baffled for the moment as her brother Percy, now\nleaning against the vicarage wall in a state of advanced\nexhaustion.\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" she said.\n\nThe maid was sympathetic.\n\n\"Mr. Ferguson, the curate, miss, he's here, if he would do.\"\n\nMaud brightened.\n\n\"He would do splendidly. Will you ask him if I can see him for a\nmoment?\"\n\n\"Very well, miss. What name, please?\"\n\n\"He won't know my name. Will you please tell him that a lady wishes\nto see him?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss. Won't you step in?\"",
        "The front door closed behind Maud. She followed the maid into the\ndrawing-room. Presently a young small curate entered. He had a\nwilling, benevolent face. He looked alert and helpful.\n\n\"You wished to see me?\"\n\n\"I am so sorry to trouble you,\" said Maud, rocking the young man in\nhis tracks with a smile of dazzling brilliancy--(\"No trouble, I\nassure you,\" said the curate dizzily)--\"but there is a man following\nme!\"\n\nThe curate clicked his tongue indignantly.",
        "\"A rough sort of a tramp kind of man. He has been following me for\nmiles, and I'm frightened.\"\n\n\"Brute!\"\n\n\"I think he's outside now. I can't think what he wants. Would\nyou--would you mind being kind enough to go and send him away?\"\n\nThe eyes that had settled George's fate for all eternity flashed\nupon the curate, who blinked. He squared his shoulders and drew\nhimself up. He was perfectly willing to die for her.\n\n\"If you will wait here,\" he said, \"I will go and send him about his",
        "business. It is disgraceful that the public highways should be\nrendered unsafe in this manner.\"\n\n\"Thank you ever so much,\" said Maud gratefully. \"I can't help\nthinking the poor fellow may be a little crazy. It seems so odd of\nhim to follow me all that way. Walking in the ditch too!\"\n\n\"Walking in the ditch!\"\n\n\"Yes. He walked most of the way in the ditch at the side of the\nroad. He seemed to prefer it. I can't think why.\"\n\nLord Belpher, leaning against the wall and trying to decide whether",
        "his right or left foot hurt him the more excruciatingly, became\naware that a curate was standing before him, regarding him through\na pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez with a disapproving and hostile\nexpression. Lord Belpher returned his gaze. Neither was favourably\nimpressed by the other. Percy thought he had seen nicer-looking\ncurates, and the curate thought he had seen more prepossessing\ntramps.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said the curate. \"This won't do, my man!\" A few hours",
        "earlier Lord Belpher had been startled when addressed by George as\n\"sir\". To be called \"my man\" took his breath away completely.\n\nThe gift of seeing ourselves as others see us is, as the poet\nindicates, vouchsafed to few men. Lord Belpher, not being one of\nthese fortunates, had not the slightest conception how intensely\nrevolting his personal appearance was at that moment. The\nred-rimmed eyes, the growth of stubble on the cheeks, and the thick",
        "coating of mud which had resulted from his rambles in the ditch\ncombined to render him a horrifying object.\n\n\"How dare you follow that young lady? I've a good mind to give you\nin charge!\"\n\nPercy was outraged.\n\n\"I'm her brother!\" He was about to substantiate the statement by\ngiving his name, but stopped himself. He had had enough of letting\nhis name come out on occasions like the present. When the\npoliceman had arrested him in the Haymarket, his first act had been",
        "to thunder his identity at the man: and the policeman, without\nsaying in so many words that he disbelieved him, had hinted\nscepticism by replying that he himself was the king of Brixton.\n\"I'm her brother!\" he repeated thickly.\n\nThe curate's disapproval deepened. In a sense, we are all brothers;\nbut that did not prevent him from considering that this mud-stained\nderelict had made an impudent and abominable mis-statement of fact.\nNot unnaturally he came to the conclusion that he had to do with a",
        "victim of the Demon Rum.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" he said severely.  \"Sad\npiece of human wreckage as you are, you speak like an educated man.\nHave you no self-respect? Do you never search your heart and\nshudder at the horrible degradation which you have brought on\nyourself by sheer weakness of will?\"\n\nHe raised his voice. The subject of Temperance was one very near to\nthe curate's heart. The vicar himself had complimented him only",
        "yesterday on the good his sermons against the drink evil were doing\nin the village, and the landlord of the Three Pigeons down the road\nhad on several occasions spoken bitter things about blighters who\ncame taking the living away from honest folks.\n\n\"It is easy enough to stop if you will but use a little resolution.\nYou say to yourself, 'Just one won't hurt me!' Perhaps not. But\ncan you be content with just one? Ah! No, my man, there is no",
        "middle way for such as you. It must be all or nothing. Stop it\nnow--now, while you still retain some semblance of humanity. Soon it\nwill be too late! Kill that craving! Stifle it! Strangle it! Make\nup your mind now--now, that not another drop of the accursed stuff\nshall pass your lips... .\"\n\nThe curate paused. He perceived that enthusiasm was leading him\naway from the main issue. \"A little perseverance,\" he concluded\nrapidly, \"and you will soon find that cocoa gives you exactly the",
        "same pleasure. And now will you please be getting along. You have\nfrightened the young lady, and she cannot continue her walk unless\nI assure her that you have gone away.\"\n\nFatigue, pain and the annoyance of having to listen to this man's\nwell-meant but ill-judged utterances had combined to induce in\nPercy a condition bordering on hysteria. He stamped his foot, and\nuttered a howl as the blister warned him with a sharp twinge that\nthis sort of behaviour could not be permitted.",
        "\"Stop talking!\" he bellowed. \"Stop talking like an idiot! I'm going\nto stay here till that girl comes out, if have to wait all day!\"\n\nThe curate regarded Percy thoughtfully. Percy was no Hercules: but\nthen, neither was the curate. And in any case, though no Hercules,\nPercy was undeniably an ugly-looking brute. Strategy, rather than\nforce, seemed to the curate to be indicated. He paused a while, as\none who weighs pros and cons, then spoke briskly, with the air of",
        "the man who has decided to yield a point with a good grace.\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" he said. \"That won't do! You say you are this young\nlady's brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do!\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you had better come with me into the house and we\nwill speak to her.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"Follow me.\"\n\nPercy followed him. Down the trim gravel walk they passed, and up\nthe neat stone steps. Maud, peeping through the curtains, thought\nherself the victim of a monstrous betrayal or equally monstrous",
        "blunder. But she did not know the Rev. Cyril Ferguson. No general,\nadroitly leading the enemy on by strategic retreat, ever had a\nsituation more thoroughly in hand. Passing with his companion\nthrough the open door, he crossed the hall to another door,\ndiscreetly closed.\n\n\"Wait in here,\" he said. Lord Belpher moved unsuspectingly forward.\nA hand pressed sharply against the small of his back. Behind him a\ndoor slammed and a key clicked. He was trapped. Groping in",
        "Egyptian darkness, his hands met a coat, then a hat, then an\numbrella. Then he stumbled over a golf-club and fell against a\nwall. It was too dark to see anything, but his sense of touch told\nhim all he needed to know. He had been added to the vicar's\ncollection of odds and ends in the closet reserved for that\npurpose.\n\nHe groped his way to the door and kicked it. He did not repeat the\nperformance. His feet were in no shape for kicking things.",
        "Percy's gallant soul abandoned the struggle. With a feeble oath, he\nsat down on a box containing croquet implements, and gave himself\nup to thought.\n\n\"You'll be quite safe now,\" the curate was saying in the adjoining\nroom, not without a touch of complacent self-approval such as\nbecomes the victor in a battle of wits. \"I have locked him in the\ncupboard. He will be quite happy there.\" An incorrect statement\nthis. \"You may now continue your walk in perfect safety.\"",
        "\"Thank you ever so much,\" said Maud. \"But I do hope he won't be\nviolent when you let him out.\"\n\n\"I shall not let him out,\" replied the curate, who, though brave,\nwas not rash. \"I shall depute the task to a worthy fellow named\nWillis, in whom I shall have every confidence. He--he is, in fact,\nour local blacksmith!\"\n\nAnd so it came about that when, after a vigil that seemed to last\nfor a lifetime, Percy heard the key turn in the lock and burst",
        "forth seeking whom he might devour, he experienced an almost\ninstant quieting of his excited nervous system. Confronting him was\na vast man whose muscles, like those of that other and more\ncelebrated village blacksmith, were plainly as strong as iron\nbands.\n\nThis man eyed Percy with a chilly eye.\n\n\"Well,\" he said. \"What's troublin' you?\"\n\nPercy gulped. The man's mere appearance was a sedative.\n\n\"Er--nothing!\" he replied. \"Nothing!\"",
        "\"There better hadn't be!\" said the man darkly. \"Mr. Ferguson give\nme this to give to you. Take it!\"\n\nPercy took it. It was a shilling.\n\n\"And this.\"\n\nThe second gift was a small paper pamphlet. It was entitled \"Now's\nthe Time!\" and seemed to be a story of some kind. At any rate,\nPercy's eyes, before they began to swim in a manner that prevented\nsteady reading, caught the words \"Job Roberts had always been a\nhard-drinking man, but one day, as he was coming out of the",
        "bar-parlour . . .\" He was about to hurl it from him, when he met\nthe other's eye and desisted. Rarely had Lord Belpher encountered a\nman with a more speaking eye.\n\n\"And now you get along,\" said the man. \"You pop off. And I'm going\nto watch you do it, too. And, if I find you sneakin' off to the\nThree Pigeons . . .\"\n\nHis pause was more eloquent than his speech and nearly as eloquent\nas his eye. Lord Belpher tucked the tract into his sweater,",
        "pocketed the shilling, and left the house. For nearly a mile down\nthe well-remembered highway he was aware of a Presence in his rear,\nbut he continued on his way without a glance behind.\n\n       \"Like one that on a lonely road\n          Doth walk in fear and dread;\n        And, having once looked back, walks on\n          And turns no more his head!\n        Because he knows a frightful fiend\n          Doth close behind him tread!\"",
        "Maud made her way across the fields to the cottage down by Platt's.\nHer heart was as light as the breeze that ruffled the green hedges.\nGaily she tripped towards the cottage door. Her hand was just\nraised to knock, when from within came the sound of a well-known\nvoice.\n\nShe had reached her goal, but her father had anticipated her. Lord\nMarshmoreton had selected the same moment as herself for paying a\ncall upon George Bevan.\n\nMaud tiptoed away, and hurried back to the castle. Never before had",
        "she so clearly realized what a handicap an adhesive family can be\nto a young girl.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16.\n\nAt the moment of Lord Marshmoreton's arrival, George was reading a\nletter from Billie Dore, which had come by that morning's post. It\ndealt mainly with the vicissitudes experienced by Miss Dore's\nfriend, Miss Sinclair, in her relations with the man Spenser Gray.\nSpenser Gray, it seemed, had been behaving oddly. Ardent towards\nMiss Sinclair almost to an embarrassing point in the early stages of",
        "their acquaintance, he had suddenly cooled; at a recent lunch had\nbehaved with a strange aloofness; and now, at this writing, had\nvanished altogether, leaving nothing behind him but an abrupt note\nto the effect that he had been compelled to go abroad and that,\nmuch as it was to be regretted, he and she would probably never\nmeet again.\n\n\"And if,\" wrote Miss Dore, justifiably annoyed, \"after saying all\nthose things to the poor kid and telling her she was the only thing",
        "in sight, he thinks he can just slide off with a 'Good-bye!  Good\nluck! and God bless you!' he's got another guess coming. And\nthat's not all. He hasn't gone abroad! I saw him in Piccadilly this\nafternoon. He saw me, too, and what do you think he did? Ducked\ndown a side-street, if you please. He must have run like a rabbit,\nat that, because, when I got there, he was nowhere to be seen. I\ntell you, George, there's something funny about all this.\"",
        "Having been made once or twice before the confidant of the\ntempestuous romances of Billie's friends, which always seemed to go\nwrong somewhere in the middle and to die a natural death before\narriving at any definite point, George was not particularly\ninterested, except in so far as the letter afforded rather\ncomforting evidence that he was not the only person in the world who\nwas having trouble of the kind. He skimmed through the rest of it,",
        "and had just finished when there was a sharp rap at the front door.\n\n\"Come in!\" called George.\n\nThere entered a sturdy little man of middle age whom at first sight\nGeorge could not place. And yet he had the impression that he had\nseen him before. Then he recognized him as the gardener to whom he\nhad given the note for Maud that day at the castle. The alteration\nin the man's costume was what had momentarily baffled George. When\nthey had met in the rose-garden, the other had been arrayed in",
        "untidy gardening clothes. Now, presumably in his Sunday suit, it\nwas amusing to observe how almost dapper he had become. Really, you\nmight have passed him in the lane and taken him for some\nneighbouring squire.\n\nGeorge's heart raced. Your lover is ever optimistic, and he could\nconceive of no errand that could have brought this man to his\ncottage unless he was charged with the delivery of a note from\nMaud. He spared a moment from his happiness to congratulate himself",
        "on having picked such an admirable go-between. Here evidently, was\none of those trusty old retainers you read about, faithful,\nwilling, discreet, ready to do anything for \"the little missy\"\n(bless her heart!). Probably he had danced Maud on his knee in her\ninfancy, and with a dog-like affection had watched her at her\nchildish sports. George beamed at the honest fellow, and felt in\nhis pocket to make sure that a suitable tip lay safely therein.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said.",
        "\"Good morning,\" replied the man.\n\nA purist might have said he spoke gruffly and without geniality.\nBut that is the beauty of these old retainers. They make a point of\ndeliberately trying to deceive strangers as to the goldenness of\ntheir hearts by adopting a forbidding manner. And \"Good morning!\"\nNot \"Good morning, sir!\" Sturdy independence, you observe, as befits\na free man. George closed the door carefully. He glanced into the\nkitchen. Mrs. Platt was not there. All was well.",
        "\"You have brought a note from Lady Maud?\"\n\nThe honest fellow's rather dour expression seemed to grow a shade\nbleaker.\n\n\"If you are alluding to Lady Maud Marsh, my daughter,\" he replied\nfrostily, \"I have not!\"\n\nFor the past few days George had been no stranger to shocks, and\nhad indeed come almost to regard them as part of the normal\neveryday life; but this latest one had a stumbling effect.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" he said.\n\n\"So you ought to,\" replied the earl.",
        "George swallowed once or twice to relieve a curious dryness of the\nmouth.\n\n\"Are you Lord Marshmoreton?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\n\"You seem surprised.\"\n\n\"It's nothing!\" muttered George. \"At least, you--I mean to say . . .\nIt's only that there's a curious resemblance between you and one\nof your gardeners at the castle. I--I daresay you have noticed it\nyourself.\"\n\n\"My hobby is gardening.\"\n\nLight broke upon George. \"Then was it really you--?\"\n\n\"It was!\"",
        "George sat down. \"This opens up a new line of thought!\" he said.\n\nLord Marshmoreton remained standing. He shook his head sternly.\n\n\"It won't do, Mr. . . . I have never heard your name.\"\n\n\"Bevan,\" replied George, rather relieved at being able to remember\nit in the midst of his mental turmoil.\n\n\"It won't do, Mr. Bevan. It must stop. I allude to this absurd\nentanglement between yourself and my daughter. It must stop at\nonce.\"\n\nIt seemed to George that such an entanglement could hardly be said",
        "to have begun, but he did not say so.\n\nLord Marshmoreton resumed his remarks. Lady Caroline had sent him\nto the cottage to be stern, and his firm resolve to be stern lent\nhis style of speech something of the measured solemnity and careful\nphrasing of his occasional orations in the House of Lords.\n\n\"I have no wish to be unduly hard upon the indiscretions of Youth.\nYouth is the period of Romance, when the heart rules the head. I\nmyself was once a young man.\"",
        "\"Well, you're practically that now,\" said George.\n\n\"Eh?\" cried Lord Marshmoreton, forgetting the thread of his\ndiscourse in the shock of pleased surprise.\n\n\"You don't look a day over forty.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, come, my boy! . . . I mean, Mr. Bevan.\"\n\n\"You don't honestly.\"\n\n\"I'm forty-eight.\"\n\n\"The Prime of Life.\"\n\n\"And you don't think I look it?\"\n\n\"You certainly don't.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well! By the way, have you tobacco, my boy. I came\nwithout my pouch.\"",
        "\"Just at your elbow. Pretty good stuff. I bought it in the village.\"\n\n\"The same I smoke myself.\"\n\n\"Quite a coincidence.\"\n\n\"Distinctly.\"\n\n\"Match?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I have one.\"\n\nGeorge filled his own pipe. The thing was becoming a love-feast.\n\n\"What was I saying?\" said Lord Marshmoreton, blowing a comfortable\ncloud. \"Oh, yes.\" He removed his pipe from his mouth with a touch of\nembarrassment. \"Yes, yes, to be sure!\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence.",
        "\"You must see for yourself,\" said the earl, \"how impossible it is.\"\n\nGeorge shook his head.\n\n\"I may be slow at grasping a thing, but I'm bound to say I can't\nsee that.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton recalled some of the things his sister had told\nhim to say. \"For one thing, what do we know of you?  You are a\nperfect stranger.\"\n\n\"Well, we're all getting acquainted pretty quick, don't you think?\nI met your son in Piccadilly and had a long talk with him, and now\nyou are paying me a neighbourly visit.\"",
        "\"This was not intended to be a social call.\"\n\n\"But it has become one.\"\n\n\"And then, that is one point I wish to make, you know. Ours is an\nold family, I would like to remind you that there were\nMarshmoretons in Belpher before the War of the Roses.\"\n\n\"There were Bevans in Brooklyn before the B.R.T.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"I was only pointing out that I can trace my ancestry a long way.\nYou have to trace things a long way in Brooklyn, if you want to\nfind them.\"\n\n\"I have never heard of Brooklyn.\"",
        "\"You've heard of New York?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"New York's one of the outlying suburbs.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton relit his pipe. He had a feeling that they were\nwandering from the point.\n\n\"It is quite impossible.\"\n\n\"I can't see it.\"\n\n\"Maud is so young.\"\n\n\"Your daughter could be nothing else.\"\n\n\"Too young to know her own mind,\" pursued Lord Marshmoreton,\nresolutely crushing down a flutter of pleasure. There was no doubt\nthat this singularly agreeable man was making things very difficult",
        "for him. It was disarming to discover that he was really capital\ncompany--the best, indeed, that the earl could remember to have\ndiscovered in the more recent period of his rather lonely life. \"At\npresent, of course, she fancies that she is very much in love with\nyou . . . It is absurd!\"\n\n\"You needn't tell me that,\" said George. Really, it was only the\nfact that people seemed to go out of their way to call at his\ncottage and tell him that Maud loved him that kept him from feeling",
        "his cause perfectly hopeless. \"It's incredible. It's a miracle.\"\n\n\"You are a romantic young man, and you no doubt for the moment\nsuppose that you are in love with her.\"\n\n\"No!\" George was not going to allow a remark like that to pass\nunchallenged. \"You are wrong there. As far as I am concerned, there\nis no question of its being momentary or supposititious or anything\nof that kind. I am in love with your daughter. I was from the first",
        "moment I saw her. I always shall be. She is the only girl in the\nworld!\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\"\n\n\"Not at all. Absolute, cold fact.\"\n\n\"You have known her so little time.\"\n\n\"Long enough.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton sighed. \"You are upsetting things terribly.\"\n\n\"Things are upsetting me terribly.\"\n\n\"You are causing a great deal of trouble and annoyance.\"\n\n\"So did Romeo.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I said--So did Romeo.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about Romeo.\"\n\n\"As far as love is concerned, I begin where he left off.\"",
        "\"I wish I could persuade you to be sensible.\"\n\n\"That's just what I think I am.\"\n\n\"I wish I could get you to see my point of view.\"\n\n\"I do see your point of view. But dimly. You see, my own takes up\nsuch a lot of the foreground.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Then I am afraid,\" said Lord Marshmoreton, \"that we must leave\nmatters as they stand.\"\n\n\"Until they can be altered for the better.\"\n\n\"We will say no more about it now.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"But I must ask you to understand clearly that I shall have to do",
        "everything in my power to stop what I look on as an unfortunate\nentanglement.\"\n\n\"I understand,\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton coughed. George looked at him with some surprise.\nHe had supposed the interview to be at an end, but the other made\nno move to go. There seemed to be something on the earl's mind.\n\n\"There is--ah--just one other thing,\" said Lord Marshmoreton. He\ncoughed again. He felt embarrassed. \"Just--just one other thing,\"\nhe repeated.",
        "The reason for Lord Marshmoreton's visit to George had been\ntwofold. In the first place, Lady Caroline had told him to go.\nThat would have been reason enough. But what made the visit\nimperative was an unfortunate accident of which he had only that\nmorning been made aware.\n\nIt will be remembered that Billie Dore had told George that the\ngardener with whom she had become so friendly had taken her name\nand address with a view later on to send her some of his roses. The",
        "scrap of paper on which this information had been written was now\nlost. Lord Marshmoreton had been hunting for it since breakfast\nwithout avail.\n\nBillie Dore had made a decided impression upon Lord Marshmoreton.\nShe belonged to a type which he had never before encountered, and\nit was one which he had found more than agreeable. Her knowledge of\nroses and the proper feeling which she manifested towards\nrose-growing as a life-work consolidated the earl's liking for her.",
        "Never, in his memory, had he come across so sensible and charming a\ngirl; and he had looked forward with a singular intensity to\nmeeting her again. And now some too zealous housemaid, tidying up\nafter the irritating manner of her species, had destroyed the only\nclue to her identity.\n\nIt was not for some time after this discovery that hope dawned\nagain for Lord Marshmoreton. Only after he had given up the search\nfor the missing paper as fruitless did he recall that it was in",
        "George's company that Billie had first come into his life. Between\nher, then, and himself George was the only link.\n\nIt was primarily for the purpose of getting Billie's name and\naddress from George that he had come to the cottage. And now that\nthe moment had arrived for touching upon the subject, he felt a\nlittle embarrassed.\n\n\"When you visited the castle,\" he said, \"when you visited the\ncastle . . .\"\n\n\"Last Thursday,\" said George helpfully.",
        "\"Exactly. When you visited the castle last Thursday, there was a\nyoung lady with you.\"\n\nNot realizing that the subject had been changed, George was under\nthe impression that the other had shifted his front and was about\nto attack him from another angle. He countered what seemed to him\nan insinuation stoutly.\n\n\"We merely happened to meet at the castle. She came there quite\nindependently of me.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton looked alarmed. \"You didn't know her?\" he said\nanxiously.",
        "\"Certainly I knew her. She is an old friend of mine. But if you are\nhinting . . .\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" rejoined the earl, profoundly relieved. \"Not at all.\nI ask merely because this young lady, with whom I had some\nconversation, was good enough to give me her name and address. She,\ntoo, happened to mistake me for a gardener.\"\n\n\"It's those corduroy trousers,\" murmured George in extenuation.\n\n\"I have unfortunately lost them.\"\n\n\"You can always get another pair.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"",
        "\"I say you can always get another pair of corduroy trousers.\"\n\n\"I have not lost my trousers. I have lost the young lady's name and\naddress.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I promised to send her some roses. She will be expecting them.\"\n\n\"That's odd. I was just reading a letter from her when you came in.\nThat must be what she's referring to when she says, 'If you see\ndadda, the old dear, tell him not to forget my roses.' I read it\nthree times and couldn't make any sense out of it. Are you Dadda?\"",
        "The earl smirked. \"She did address me in the course of our\nconversation as dadda.\"\n\n\"Then the message is for you.\"\n\n\"A very quaint and charming girl. What is her name? And where can I\nfind her?\"\n\n\"Her name's Billie Dore.\"\n\n\"Billie?\"\n\n\"Billie.\"\n\n\"Billie!\" said Lord Marshmoreton softly. \"I had better write it\ndown. And her address?\"\n\n\"I don't know her private address. But you could always reach her\nat the Regal Theatre.\"\n\n\"Ah! She is on the stage?\"\n\n\"Yes. She's in my piece, 'Follow the Girl'.\"",
        "\"Indeed! Are you a playwright, Mr. Bevan?\"\n\n\"Good Lord, no!\" said George, shocked. \"I'm a composer.\"\n\n\"Very interesting. And you met Miss Dore through her being in this\nplay of yours?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I knew her before she went on the stage. She was a\nstenographer in a music-publisher's office when we first met.\"\n\n\"Good gracious! Was she really a stenographer?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"Oh--ah--nothing, nothing. Something just happened to come to my\nmind.\"",
        "What happened to come into Lord Marshmoreton's mind was a fleeting\nvision of Billie installed in Miss Alice Faraday's place as his\nsecretary. With such a helper it would be a pleasure to work on\nthat infernal Family History which was now such a bitter toil. But\nthe day-dream passed. He knew perfectly well that he had not the\ncourage to dismiss Alice. In the hands of that calm-eyed girl he\nwas as putty. She exercised over him the hypnotic spell a\nlion-tamer exercises over his little playmates.",
        "\"We have been pals for years,\" said George. \"Billie is one of the\nbest fellows in the world.\"\n\n\"A charming girl.\"\n\n\"She would give her last nickel to anyone that asked for it.\"\n\n\"Delightful!\"\n\n\"And as straight as a string. No one ever said a word against\nBillie.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"She may go out to lunch and supper and all that kind of thing, but\nthere's nothing to that.\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" agreed the earl warmly. \"Girls must eat!\"\n\n\"They do. You ought to see them.\"",
        "\"A little harmless relaxation after the fatigue of the day!\"\n\n\"Exactly. Nothing more.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton felt more drawn than ever to this sensible young\nman--sensible, at least, on all points but one. It was a pity they\ncould not see eye to eye on what was and what was not suitable in\nthe matter of the love-affairs of the aristocracy.\n\n\"So you are a composer, Mr. Bevan?\" he said affably.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton gave a little sigh. \"It's a long time since I",
        "went to see a musical performance. More than twenty years. When I\nwas up at Oxford, and for some years afterwards, I was a great\ntheatre-goer. Never used to miss a first night at the Gaiety. Those\nwere the days of Nellie Farren and Kate Vaughan. Florence St.\nJohn, too. How excellent she was in Faust Up To Date! But we missed\nNellie Farren. Meyer Lutz was the Gaiety composer then. But a good\ndeal of water has flowed under the bridge since those days. I don't",
        "suppose you have ever heard of Meyer Lutz?\"\n\n\"I don't think I have.\"\n\n\"Johnnie Toole was playing a piece called Partners. Not a good\nplay. And the Yeoman of the Guard had just been produced at the\nSavoy. That makes it seem a long time ago, doesn't it? Well, I\nmustn't take up all your time. Good-bye, Mr. Bevan. I am glad to\nhave had the opportunity of this little talk. The Regal Theatre, I\nthink you said, is where your piece is playing? I shall probably be",
        "going to London shortly. I hope to see it.\" Lord Marshmoreton rose.\n\"As regards the other matter, there is no hope of inducing you to\nsee the matter in the right light?\"\n\n\"We seem to disagree as to which is the right light.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing more to be said. I will be perfectly frank\nwith you, Mr. Bevan. I like you . . .\"\n\n\"The feeling is quite mutual.\"\n\n\"But I don't want you as a son-in-law. And, dammit,\" exploded Lord\nMarshmoreton, \"I won't have you as a son-in-law! Good God! do you",
        "think that you can harry and assault my son Percy in the heart of\nPiccadilly and generally make yourself a damned nuisance and then\nsettle down here without an invitation at my very gates and expect\nto be welcomed into the bosom of the family? If I were a young\nman . . .\"\n\n\"I thought we had agreed that you were a young man.\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt me!\"\n\n\"I only said . . .\"\n\n\"I heard what you said. Flattery!\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind. Truth.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton melted. He smiled. \"Young idiot!\"",
        "\"We agree there all right.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton hesitated. Then with a rush he unbosomed himself,\nand made his own position on the matter clear.\n\n\"I know what you'll be saying to yourself the moment my back is\nturned. You'll be calling me a stage heavy father and an old snob\nand a number of other things. Don't interrupt me, dammit! You will,\nI tell you! And you'll be wrong. I don't think the Marshmoretons\nare fenced off from the rest of the world by some sort of divinity.",
        "My sister does. Percy does. But Percy's an ass! If ever you find\nyourself thinking differently from my son Percy, on any subject,\ncongratulate yourself. You'll be right.\"\n\n\"But . . .\"\n\n\"I know what you're going to say. Let me finish. If I were the only\nperson concerned, I wouldn't stand in Maud's way, whoever she\nwanted to marry, provided he was a good fellow and likely to make\nher happy. But I'm not.

The whole gabbling pack of them would be at me, saying I was\nto blame. There would be arguments, discussions, family councils!\nI hate arguments! I loathe discussions! Family councils make me",
        "sick! I'm a peaceable man, and I like a quiet life! And, damme,\nI'm going to have it. So there's the thing for you in letters of\none syllable. I don't object to you personally, but I'm not going\nto have you bothering me like this. I'll admit freely that, since I\nhave made your acquaintance, I have altered the unfavourable\nopinion I had formed of you from--from hearsay. . .\"\n\n\"Exactly the same with me,\" said George. \"You ought never to",

I say I have changed my opinion of you to a great\nextent. I mention this unofficially, as a matter that has no\nbearing on the main issue; for, as regards any idea you may have of\ninducing me to agree to your marrying my daughter, let me tell you\nthat I am unalterably opposed to any such thing!\"\n\n\"Don't say that.\"",
        "\"What the devil do you mean--don't say that! I do say that!  It is\nout of the question. Do you understand? Very well, then. Good\nmorning.\"\n\nThe door closed. Lord Marshmoreton walked away feeling that he had\nbeen commendably stern. George filled his pipe and sat smoking\nthoughtfully. He wondered what Maud was doing at that moment.\n\nMaud at that moment was greeting her brother with a bright smile,\nas he limped downstairs after a belated shave and change of\ncostume.",
        "\"Oh, Percy, dear,\" she was saying, \"I had quite an adventure\nthis morning. An awful tramp followed me for miles! Such a\nhorrible-looking brute. I was so frightened that I had to ask\na curate in the next village to drive him away. I did wish I\nhad had you there to protect me. Why don't you come out with\nme sometimes when I take a country walk? It really isn't safe\nfor me to be alone!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17.\n\nThe gift of hiding private emotion and keeping up appearances",
        "before strangers is not, as many suppose, entirely a product of our\nmodern civilization. Centuries before we were born or thought of\nthere was a widely press-agented boy in Sparta who even went so far\nas to let a fox gnaw his tender young stomach without permitting\nthe discomfort inseparable from such a proceeding to interfere with\neither his facial expression or his flow of small talk. Historians\nhave handed it down that, even in the later stages of the meal, the",
        "polite lad continued to be the life and soul of the party. But,\nwhile this feat may be said to have established a record never\nsubsequently lowered, there is no doubt that almost every day in\nmodern times men and women are performing similar and scarcely less\nimpressive miracles of self-restraint. Of all the qualities which\nbelong exclusively to Man and are not shared by the lower animals,\nthis surely is the one which marks him off most sharply from the",
        "beasts of the field. Animals care nothing about keeping up\nappearances. Observe Bertram the Bull when things are not going just\nas he could wish. He stamps. He snorts. He paws the ground. He\nthrows back his head and bellows. He is upset, and he doesn't care\nwho knows it. Instances could be readily multiplied. Deposit a\ncharge of shot in some outlying section of Thomas the Tiger, and\nnote the effect. Irritate Wilfred the Wasp, or stand behind Maud",
        "the Mule and prod her with a pin. There is not an animal on the\nlist who has even a rudimentary sense of the social amenities; and\nit is this more than anything else which should make us proud that\nwe are human beings on a loftier plane of development.\n\nIn the days which followed Lord Marshmoreton's visit to George at\nthe cottage, not a few of the occupants of Belpher Castle had their\nmettle sternly tested in this respect; and it is a pleasure to be",
        "able to record that not one of them failed to come through the\nordeal with success. The general public, as represented by the\nuncles, cousins, and aunts who had descended on the place to help\nLord Belpher celebrate his coming-of-age, had not a notion that\nturmoil lurked behind the smooth fronts of at least half a dozen of\nthose whom they met in the course of the daily round.\n\nLord Belpher, for example, though he limped rather painfully,",
        "showed nothing of the baffled fury which was reducing his weight at\nthe rate of ounces a day. His uncle Francis, the Bishop, when he\ntackled him in the garden on the subject of Intemperance--for Uncle\nFrancis, like thousands of others, had taken it for granted, on\nreading the report of the encounter with the policeman and Percy's\nsubsequent arrest, that the affair had been the result of a drunken\noutburst--had no inkling of the volcanic emotions that seethed in",
        "his nephew's bosom. He came away from the interview, indeed,\nfeeling that the boy had listened attentively and with a becoming\nregret, and that there was hope for him after all, provided that he\nfought the impulse. He little knew that, but for the conventions\n(which frown on the practice of murdering bishops), Percy would\ngladly have strangled him with his bare hands and jumped upon the\nremains.\n\nLord Belpher's case, inasmuch as he took himself extremely",
        "seriously and was not one of those who can extract humour even from\ntheir own misfortunes, was perhaps the hardest which comes under\nour notice; but his sister Maud was also experiencing mental\ndisquietude of no mean order. Everything had gone wrong with Maud.\nBarely a mile separated her from George, that essential link in her\nchain of communication with Geoffrey Raymond; but so thickly did it\nbristle with obstacles and dangers that it might have been a mile",
        "of No Man's Land. Twice, since the occasion when the discovery of\nLord Marshmoreton at the cottage had caused her to abandon her\npurpose of going in and explaining everything to George, had she\nattempted to make the journey; and each time some trifling,\nmaddening accident had brought about failure. Once, just as she was\nstarting, her aunt Augusta had insisted on joining her for what she\ndescribed as \"a nice long walk\"; and the second time, when she was",
        "within a bare hundred yards of her objective, some sort of a cousin\npopped out from nowhere and forced his loathsome company on her.\n\nFoiled in this fashion, she had fallen back in desperation on her\nsecond line of attack. She had written a note to George, explaining\nthe whole situation in good, clear phrases and begging him as a man\nof proved chivalry to help her. It had taken up much of one\nafternoon, this note, for it was not easy to write; and it had",
        "resulted in nothing. She had given it to Albert to deliver and\nAlbert had returned empty-handed.\n\n\"The gentleman said there was no answer, m'lady!\"\n\n\"No answer! But there must be an answer!\"\n\n\"No answer, m'lady. Those was his very words,\" stoutly maintained\nthe black-souled boy, who had destroyed the letter within two\nminutes after it had been handed to him. He had not even bothered\nto read it. A deep, dangerous, dastardly stripling this, who fought",
        "to win and only to win. The ticket marked \"R. Byng\" was in his\npocket, and in his ruthless heart a firm resolve that R. Byng and\nno other should have the benefit of his assistance.\n\nMaud could not understand it. That is to say, she resolutely kept\nherself from accepting the only explanation of the episode that\nseemed possible. In black and white she had asked George to go to\nLondon and see Geoffrey and arrange for the passage--through",
        "himself as a sort of clearing-house--of letters between Geoffrey\nand herself. She had felt from the first that such a request should\nbe made by her in person and not through the medium of writing, but\nsurely it was incredible that a man like George, who had been\nthrough so much for her and whose only reason for being in the\nneighbourhood was to help her, could have coldly refused without\neven a word. And yet what else was she to think? Now, more than\never, she felt alone in a hostile world.",
        "Yet, to her guests she was bright and entertaining. Not one of them\nhad a suspicion that her life was not one of pure sunshine.\n\nAlbert, I am happy to say, was thoroughly miserable. The little\nbrute was suffering torments. He was showering anonymous Advice to\nthe Lovelorn on Reggie Byng--excellent stuff, culled from the pages\nof weekly papers, of which there was a pile in the housekeeper's\nroom, the property of a sentimental lady's maid--and nothing seemed",
        "to come of it. Every day, sometimes twice and thrice a day, he\nwould leave on Reggie's dressing-table significant notes similar in\ntone to the one which he had placed there on the night of the ball;\nbut, for all the effect they appeared to exercise on their\nrecipient, they might have been blank pages.\n\nThe choicest quotations from the works of such established writers\nas \"Aunt Charlotte\" of Forget-Me-Not and \"Doctor Cupid\", the\nheart-expert of Home Chat, expended themselves fruitlessly on",
        "Reggie. As far as Albert could ascertain--and he was one of those\nboys who ascertain practically everything within a radius of\nmiles--Reggie positively avoided Maud's society.\n\nAnd this after reading \"Doctor Cupid's\" invaluable tip about\n\"Seeking her company on all occasions\" and the dictum of \"Aunt\nCharlotte\" to the effect that \"Many a wooer has won his lady by\nbeing persistent\"--Albert spelled it \"persistuent\" but the effect\nis the same--\"and rendering himself indispensable by constant",
        "little attentions\". So far from rendering himself indispensable to\nMaud by constant little attentions, Reggie, to the disgust of his\nbacker and supporter, seemed to spend most of his time with Alice\nFaraday. On three separate occasions had Albert been revolted by\nthe sight of his protege in close association with the Faraday\ngirl--once in a boat on the lake and twice in his grey car. It was\nenough to break a boy's heart; and it completely spoiled Albert's",
        "appetite--a phenomenon attributed, I am glad to say, in the\nServants' Hall to reaction from recent excesses. The moment when\nKeggs, the butler, called him a greedy little pig and hoped it\nwould be a lesson to him not to stuff himself at all hours with\nstolen cakes was a bitter moment for Albert.\n\nIt is a relief to turn from the contemplation of these tortured\nsouls to the pleasanter picture presented by Lord Marshmoreton.\nHere, undeniably, we have a man without a secret sorrow, a man at",
        "peace with this best of all possible worlds. Since his visit to\nGeorge a second youth seems to have come upon Lord Marshmoreton. He\nworks in his rose-garden with a new vim, whistling or even singing\nto himself stray gay snatches of melodies popular in the 'eighties.\n\nHear him now as he toils. He has a long garden-implement in his\nhand, and he is sending up the death-rate in slug circles with a\ndevastating rapidity.\n\n            \"Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay\n             Ta-ra-ra BOOM--\"",
        "And the boom is a death-knell. As it rings softly out on the\npleasant spring air, another stout slug has made the Great Change.\n\nIt is peculiar, this gaiety. It gives one to think. Others have\nnoticed it, his lordship's valet amongst them.\n\n\"I give you my honest word, Mr. Keggs,\" says the valet, awed, \"this\nvery morning I 'eard the old devil a-singing in 'is barth!\nChirruping away like a blooming linnet!\"\n\n\"Lor!\" says Keggs, properly impressed.",
        "\"And only last night 'e gave me 'arf a box of cigars and said I was\na good, faithful feller! I tell you, there's somethin' happened to\nthe old buster--you mark my words!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18.\n\nOver this complex situation the mind of Keggs, the butler, played\nlike a searchlight. Keggs was a man of discernment and sagacity. He\nhad instinct and reasoning power. Instinct told him that Maud, all\nunsuspecting the change that had taken place in Albert's attitude",
        "toward her romance, would have continued to use the boy as a link\nbetween herself and George:  and reason, added to an intimate\nknowledge of Albert, enabled him to see that the latter must\ninevitably have betrayed her trust. He was prepared to bet a\nhundred pounds that Albert had been given letters to deliver and\nhad destroyed them. So much was clear to Keggs. It only remained to\nsettle on some plan of action which would re-establish the broken",
        "connection. Keggs did not conceal a tender heart beneath a rugged\nexterior: he did not mourn over the picture of two loving fellow\nhuman beings separated by a misunderstanding; but he did want to\nwin that sweepstake.\n\nHis position, of course, was delicate. He could not go to Maud and\nbeg her to confide in him. Maud would not understand his motives,\nand might leap to the not unjustifiable conclusion that he had been\nat the sherry. No! Men were easier to handle than women. As soon as",
        "his duties would permit--and in the present crowded condition of\nthe house they were arduous--he set out for George's cottage.\n\n\"I trust I do not disturb or interrupt you, sir,\" he said, beaming\nin the doorway like a benevolent high priest. He had doffed his\nprofessional manner of austere disapproval, as was his custom in\nmoments of leisure.\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied George, puzzled. \"Was there anything . . .?\"\n\n\"There was, sir.\"\n\n\"Come along in and sit down.\"",
        "\"I would not take the liberty, if it is all the same to you, sir. I\nwould prefer to remain standing.\"\n\nThere was a moment of uncomfortable silence. Uncomfortable, that is\nto say, on the part of George, who was wondering if the butler\nremembered having engaged him as a waiter only a few nights back.\nKeggs himself was at his ease. Few things ruffled this man.\n\n\"Fine day,\" said George.\n\n\"Extremely, sir, but for the rain.\"\n\n\"Oh, is it raining?\"\n\n\"Sharp downpour, sir.\"",
        "\"Good for the crops,\" said George.\n\n\"So one would be disposed to imagine, sir.\"\n\nSilence fell again. The rain dripped from the eaves.\n\n\"If I might speak freely, sir . . .?\" said Keggs.\n\n\"Sure. Shoot!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir?\"\n\n\"I mean, yes. Go ahead!\"\n\nThe butler cleared his throat.\n\n\"Might I begin by remarking that your little affair of the 'eart,\nif I may use the expression, is no secret in the Servants' 'All? I\n'ave no wish to seem to be taking a liberty or presuming, but I",
        "should like to intimate that the Servants' 'All is aware of the\nfacts.\"\n\n\"You don't have to tell me that,\" said George coldly. \"I know all\nabout the sweepstake.\"\n\nA flicker of embarrassment passed over the butler's large, smooth\nface--passed, and was gone.\n\n\"I did not know that you 'ad been apprised of that little matter,\nsir. But you will doubtless understand and appreciate our point of\nview. A little sporting flutter--nothing more--designed to\nhalleviate the monotony of life in the country.\"",
        "\"Oh, don't apologize,\" said George, and was reminded of a point\nwhich had exercised him a little from time to time since his vigil\non the balcony. \"By the way, if it isn't giving away secrets, who\ndrew Plummer?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Which of you drew a man named Plummer in the sweep?\"\n\n\"I rather fancy, sir,\" Keggs' brow wrinkled in thought, \"I rather\nfancy it was one of the visiting gentlemen's gentlemen. I gave the\npoint but slight attention at the time. I did not fancy Mr.",
        "Plummer's chances. It seemed to me that Mr. Plummer was a\nnegligible quantity.\"\n\n\"Your knowledge of form was sound. Plummer's out!\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir! An amiable young gentleman, but lacking in many of\nthe essential qualities. Perhaps he struck you that way, sir?\"\n\n\"I never met him. Nearly, but not quite!\"\n\n\"It entered my mind that you might possibly have encountered Mr.\nPlummer on the night of the ball, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, I was wondering if you remembered me!\"",
        "\"I remember you perfectly, sir, and it was the fact that we had\nalready met in what one might almost term a social way that\nemboldened me to come 'ere today and offer you my services as a\nhintermediary, should you feel disposed to avail yourself of them.\"\n\nGeorge was puzzled.\n\n\"Your services?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir. I fancy I am in a position to lend you what might\nbe termed an 'elping 'and.\"\n\n\"But that's remarkably altruistic of you, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"",
        "\"I say that is very generous of you. Aren't you forgetting that you\ndrew Mr. Byng?\"\n\nThe butler smiled indulgently.\n\n\"You are not quite abreast of the progress of events, sir. Since\nthe original drawing of names, there 'as been a trifling\nhadjustment. The boy Albert now 'as Mr. Byng and I 'ave you, sir. A\nlittle amicable arrangement informally conducted in the scullery on\nthe night of the ball.\"\n\n\"Amicable?\"\n\n\"On my part, entirely so.\"",
        "George began to understand certain things that had been perplexing\nto him.\n\n\"Then all this while. . .?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir. All this while 'er ladyship, under the impression\nthat the boy Albert was devoted to 'er cause, has no doubt been\nplacing a misguided confidence in 'im . . . The little blighter!\"\nsaid Keggs, abandoning for a moment his company manners and\npermitting vehemence to take the place of polish. \"I beg your\npardon for the expression, sir,\" he added gracefully. \"It escaped",
        "me inadvertently.\"\n\n\"You think that Lady Maud gave Albert a letter to give to me, and\nthat he destroyed it?\"\n\n\"Such, I should imagine, must undoubtedly have been the case. The\nboy 'as no scruples, no scruples whatsoever.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\"\n\n\"I appreciate your consternation, sir.\"\n\n\"That must be exactly what has happened.\"\n\n\"To my way of thinking there is no doubt of it. It was for that\nreason that I ventured to come 'ere. In the 'ope that I might be\nhinstrumental in arranging a meeting.\"",
        "The strong distaste which George had had for plotting with this\noverfed menial began to wane. It might be undignified, he told\nhimself but it was undeniably practical. And, after all, a man who\nhas plotted with page-boys has little dignity to lose by plotting\nwith butlers. He brightened up. If it meant seeing Maud again he\nwas prepared to waive the decencies.\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" he said.\n\n\"It being a rainy evening and everyone indoors playing games and",
        "what not,\"--Keggs was amiably tolerant of the recreations of the\naristocracy--\"you would experience little chance of a hinterruption,\nwere you to proceed to the lane outside the heast entrance of the\ncastle grounds and wait there. You will find in the field at the\nroadside a small disused barn only a short way from the gates, where\nyou would be sheltered from the rain. In the meantime, I would\nhinform 'er ladyship of your movements, and no doubt it would be\npossible for 'er to slip off.\"",
        "\"It sounds all right.\"\n\n\"It is all right, sir. The chances of a hinterruption may be said\nto be reduced to a minimum. Shall we say in one hour's time?\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Then I will wish you good evening, sir. Thank you, sir. I am glad\nto 'ave been of assistance.\"\n\nHe withdrew as he had come, with a large impressiveness. The room\nseemed very empty without him. George, with trembling fingers,\nbegan to put on a pair of thick boots.\n\nFor some minutes after he had set foot outside the door of the",
        "cottage, George was inclined to revile the weather for having\nplayed him false. On this evening of all evenings, he felt, the\nelements should, so to speak, have rallied round and done their\nbit. The air should have been soft and clear and scented: there\nshould have been an afterglow of sunset in the sky to light him on\nhis way. Instead, the air was full of that peculiar smell of\nhopeless dampness which comes at the end of a wet English day. The",
        "sky was leaden. The rain hissed down in a steady flow, whispering\nof mud and desolation, making a dreary morass of the lane through\nwhich he tramped. A curious sense of foreboding came upon George.\nIt was as if some voice of the night had murmured maliciously in\nhis ear a hint of troubles to come. He felt oddly nervous, as he\nentered the barn.\n\nThe barn was both dark and dismal. In one of the dark corners an\nintermittent dripping betrayed the presence of a gap in its ancient",
        "roof. A rat scurried across the floor. The dripping stopped and\nbegan again. George struck a match and looked at his watch. He was\nearly. Another ten minutes must elapse before he could hope for her\narrival. He sat down on a broken wagon which lay on its side\nagainst one of the walls.\n\nDepression returned. It was impossible to fight against it in this\nbeast of a barn. The place was like a sepulchre. No one but a fool\nof a butler would have suggested it as a trysting-place. He",
        "wondered irritably why places like this were allowed to get into\nthis condition. If people wanted a barn earnestly enough to take\nthe trouble of building one, why was it not worth while to keep the\nthing in proper repair? Waste and futility! That was what it was.\nThat was what everything was, if you came down to it. Sitting here,\nfor instance, was a futile waste of time. She wouldn't come. There\nwere a dozen reasons why she should not come. So what was the use",
        "of his courting rheumatism by waiting in this morgue of dead\nagricultural ambitions? None whatever--George went on waiting.\n\nAnd what an awful place to expect her to come to, if by some miracle\nshe did come--where she would be stifled by the smell of mouldy hay,\ndamped by raindrops and--reflected George gloomily as there was\nanother scurry and scutter along the unseen floor--gnawed by rats.\nYou could not expect a delicately-nurtured girl, accustomed to all",
        "the comforts of a home, to be bright and sunny with a platoon of\nrats crawling all over her. . . .\n\nThe grey oblong that was the doorway suddenly darkened.\n\n\"Mr. Bevan!\"\n\nGeorge sprang up. At the sound of her voice every nerve in his body\ndanced in mad exhilaration. He was another man. Depression fell\nfrom him like a garment. He perceived that he had misjudged all\nsorts of things. The evening, for instance, was a splendid\nevening--not one of those awful dry, baking evenings which make you",
        "feel you can't breathe, but pleasantly moist and full of a\ndelightfully musical patter of rain. And the barn! He had been all\nwrong about the barn. It was a great little place, comfortable,\nairy, and cheerful. What could be more invigorating than that smell\nof hay? Even the rats, he felt, must be pretty decent rats, when\nyou came to know them.\n\n\"I'm here!\"\n\nMaud advanced quickly. His eyes had grown accustomed to the murk,\nand he could see her dimly. The smell of her damp raincoat came to",
        "him like a breath of ozone. He could even see her eyes shining in\nthe darkness, so close was she to him.\n\n\"I hope you've not been waiting long?\"\n\nGeorge's heart was thundering against his ribs. He could scarcely\nspeak. He contrived to emit a No.\n\n\"I didn't think at first I could get away. I had to . . .\" She\nbroke off with a cry. The rat, fond of exercise like all rats, had\nmade another of its excitable sprints across the floor.\n\nA hand clutched nervously at George's arm, found it and held it.",
        "And at the touch the last small fragment of George's self-control\nfled from him. The world became vague and unreal. There remained\nof it but one solid fact--the fact that Maud was in his arms and\nthat he was saying a number of things very rapidly in a voice that\nseemed to belong to somebody he had never met before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19.\n\nWith a shock of dismay so abrupt and overwhelming that it was like\na physical injury, George became aware that something was wrong.",
        "Even as he gripped her, Maud had stiffened with a sharp cry; and\nnow she was struggling, trying to wrench herself free. She broke\naway from him. He could hear her breathing hard.\n\n\"You--you----\" She gulped.\n\n\"Maud!\"\n\n\"How dare you!\"\n\nThere was a pause that seemed to George to stretch on and on\nendlessly. The rain pattered on the leaky roof. Somewhere in the\ndistance a dog howled dismally. The darkness pressed down like a\nblanket, stifling thought.",
        "\"Good night, Mr. Bevan.\" Her voice was ice. \"I didn't think you\nwere--that kind of man.\"\n\nShe was moving toward the door; and, as she reached it, George's\nstupor left him. He came back to life with a jerk, shaking from\nhead to foot. All his varied emotions had become one emotion--a\ncold fury.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nMaud stopped. Her chin was tilted, and she was wasting a baleful\nglare on the darkness.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\nHer tone increased George's wrath. The injustice of it made him",
        "dizzy. At that moment he hated her. He was the injured party. It\nwas he, not she, that had been deceived and made a fool of.\n\n\"I want to say something before you go.\"\n\n\"I think we had better say no more about it!\"\n\nBy the exercise of supreme self-control George kept himself from\nspeaking until he could choose milder words than those that rushed\nto his lips.\n\n\"I think we will!\" he said between his teeth.\n\nMaud's anger became tinged with surprise. Now that the first shock",
        "of the wretched episode was over, the calmer half of her mind was\nendeavouring to soothe the infuriated half by urging that George's\nbehaviour had been but a momentary lapse, and that a man may lose\nhis head for one wild instant, and yet remain fundamentally a\ngentleman and a friend. She had begun to remind herself that this\nman had helped her once in trouble, and only a day or two before\nhad actually risked his life to save her from embarrassment. When",
        "she heard him call to her to stop, she supposed that his better\nfeelings had reasserted themselves; and she had prepared herself to\nreceive with dignity a broken, stammered apology. But the voice\nthat had just spoken with a crisp, biting intensity was not the\nvoice of remorse. It was a very angry man, not a penitent one, who\nwas commanding--not begging--her to stop and listen to him.\n\n\"Well?\" she said again, more coldly this time. She was quite unable",
        "to understand this attitude of his. She was the injured party. It\nwas she, not he who had trusted and been betrayed.\n\n\"I should like to explain.\"\n\n\"Please do not apologize.\"\n\nGeorge ground his teeth in the gloom.\n\n\"I haven't the slightest intention of apologizing. I said I would\nlike to explain. When I have finished explaining, you can go.\"\n\n\"I shall go when I please,\" flared Maud.\n\nThis man was intolerable.\n\n\"There is nothing to be afraid of. There will be no repetition of\nthe--incident.\"",
        "Maud was outraged by this monstrous misinterpretation of her words.\n\n\"I am not afraid!\"\n\n\"Then, perhaps, you will be kind enough to listen. I won't detain\nyou long. My explanation is quite simple. I have been made a fool\nof. I seem to be in the position of the tinker in the play whom\neverybody conspired to delude into the belief that he was a king.\nFirst a friend of yours, Mr. Byng, came to me and told me that you\nhad confided to him that you loved me.\"",
        "Maud gasped. Either this man was mad, or Reggie Byng was. She\nchoose the politer solution.\n\n\"Reggie Byng must have lost his senses.\"\n\n\"So I supposed. At least, I imagined that he must be mistaken. But a\nman in love is an optimistic fool, of course, and I had loved you\never since you got into my cab that morning . . .\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"So after a while,\" proceeded George, ignoring the interruption, \"I\nalmost persuaded myself that miracles could still happen, and that",
        "what Byng said was true. And when your father called on me and told\nme the very same thing I was convinced. It seemed incredible, but I\nhad to believe it. Now it seems that, for some inscrutable reason,\nboth Byng and your father were making a fool of me. That's all.\nGood night.\"\n\nMaud's reply was the last which George or any man would have\nexpected. There was a moment's silence, and then she burst into a\npeal of laughter. It was the laughter of over-strained nerves, but",
        "to George's ears it had the ring of genuine amusement.\n\n\"I'm glad you find my story entertaining,\" he said dryly. He was\nconvinced now that he loathed this girl, and that all he desired\nwas to see her go out of his life for ever. \"Later, no doubt, the\nfunny side of it will hit me. Just at present my sense of humour is\nrather dormant.\"\n\nMaud gave a little cry.\n\n\"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Mr. Bevan. It wasn't that. It wasn't that\nat all. Oh, I am so sorry. I don't know why I laughed. It certainly",
        "wasn't because I thought it funny. It's tragic. There's been a\ndreadful mistake!\"\n\n\"I noticed that,\" said George bitterly. The darkness began to\nafflict his nerves. \"I wish to God we had some light.\"\n\nThe glare of a pocket-torch smote upon him.\n\n\"I brought it to see my way back with,\" said Maud in a curious,\nsmall voice. \"It's very dark across the fields. I didn't light it\nbefore, because I was afraid somebody might see.\"\n\nShe came towards him, holding the torch over her head. The beam",
        "showed her face, troubled and sympathetic, and at the sight all\nGeorge's resentment left him. There were mysteries here beyond his\nunravelling, but of one thing he was certain: this girl was not to\nblame. She was a thoroughbred, as straight as a wand. She was pure\ngold.\n\n\"I came here to tell you everything,\" she said. She placed the\ntorch on the wagon-wheel so that its ray fell in a pool of light on\nthe ground between them. \"I'll do it now. Only--only it isn't so",
        "easy now. Mr. Bevan, there's a man--there's a man that father and\nReggie Byng mistook--they thought . . . You see, they knew it was\nyou that I was with that day in the cab, and so they naturally\nthought, when you came down here, that you were the man I had gone\nto meet that day--the man I--I--\"\n\n\"The man you love.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Maud in a small voice; and there was silence again.\n\nGeorge could feel nothing but sympathy. It mastered other emotion",
        "in him, even the grey despair that had come her words. He could\nfeel all that she was feeling.\n\n\"Tell me all about it,\" he said.\n\n\"I met him in Wales last year.\" Maud's voice was a whisper.  \"The\nfamily found out, and I was hurried back here, and have been here\never since. That day when I met you I had managed to slip away from\nhome. I had found out that he was in London, and I was going to\nmeet him. Then I saw Percy, and got into your cab. It's all been a\nhorrible mistake. I'm sorry.\"",
        "\"I see,\" said George thoughtfully. \"I see.\"\n\nHis heart ached like a living wound. She had told so little, and\nhe could guess so much. This unknown man who had triumphed seemed\nto sneer scornfully at him from the shadows.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Maud again.\n\n\"You mustn't feel like that. How can I help you? That's the point.\nWhat is it you want me to do?\"\n\n\"But I can't ask you now.\"\n\n\"Of course you can. Why not?\"\n\n\"Why--oh, I couldn't!\"\n\nGeorge managed to laugh. It was a laugh that did not sound",
        "convincing even to himself, but it served.\n\n\"That's morbid,\" he said. \"Be sensible. You need help, and I may be\nable to give it. Surely a man isn't barred for ever from doing you\na service just because he happens to love you?  Suppose you were\ndrowning and Mr. Plummer was the only swimmer within call, wouldn't\nyou let him rescue you?\"\n\n\"Mr. Plummer? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You've not forgotten that I was a reluctant ear-witness to his\nrecent proposal of marriage?\"\n\nMaud uttered an exclamation.",
        "\"I never asked! How terrible of me. Were you much hurt?\"\n\n\"Hurt?\" George could not follow her.\n\n\"That night. When you were on the balcony, and--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" George understood. \"Oh, no, hardly at all. A few scratches. I\nscraped my hands a little.\"\n\n\"It was a wonderful thing to do,\" said Maud, her admiration glowing\nfor a man who could treat such a leap so lightly. She had always\nhad a private theory that Lord Leonard, after performing the same\nfeat, had bragged about it for the rest of his life.",
        "\"No, no, nothing,\" said George, who had since wondered why he had\never made such a to-do about climbing up a perfectly stout sheet.\n\n\"It was splendid!\"\n\nGeorge blushed.\n\n\"We are wandering from the main theme,\" he said. \"I want to help\nyou. I came here at enormous expense to help you. How can I do\nit?\"\n\nMaud hesitated.\n\n\"I think you may be offended at my asking such a thing.\"\n\n\"You needn't.\"\n\n\"You see, the whole trouble is that I can't get in touch with",
        "Geoffrey. He's in London, and I'm here. And any chance I might have\nof getting to London vanished that day I met you, when Percy saw me\nin Piccadilly.\"\n\n\"How did your people find out it was you?\"\n\n\"They asked me--straight out.\"\n\n\"And you owned up?\"\n\n\"I had to. I couldn't tell them a direct lie.\"\n\nGeorge thrilled. This was the girl he had had doubts of.\n\n\"So than it was worse then ever,\" continued Maud. \"I daren't risk\nwriting to Geoffrey and having the letter intercepted. I was",
        "wondering--I had the idea almost as soon as I found that you had\ncome here--\"\n\n\"You want me to take a letter from you and see that it reaches him.\nAnd then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the\nletter to you?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I do want. But I almost didn't like to ask.\"\n\n\"Why not? I'll be delighted to do it.\"\n\n\"I'm so grateful.\"\n\n\"Why, it's nothing. I thought you were going to ask me to look in\non your brother and smash another of his hats.\"",
        "Maud laughed delightedly. The whole tension of the situation had\nbeen eased for her. More and more she found herself liking George.\nYet, deep down in her, she realized with a pang that for him there\nhad been no easing of the situation. She was sad for George. The\nPlummers of this world she had consigned to what they declared\nwould be perpetual sorrow with scarcely a twinge of regret. But\nGeorge was different.\n\n\"Poor Percy!\" she said. \"I don't suppose he'll ever get over it. He",
        "will have other hats, but it won't be the same.\" She came back to\nthe subject nearest her heart. \"Mr. Bevan, I wonder if you would do\njust a little more for me?\"\n\n\"If it isn't criminal. Or, for that matter, if it is.\"\n\n\"Could you go to Geoffrey, and see him, and tell him all about me\nand--and come back and tell me how he looks, and what he said\nand--and so on?\"\n\n\"Certainly. What is his name, and where do I find him?\"\n\n\"I never told you. How stupid of me. His name is Geoffrey Raymond,",
        "and he lives with his uncle, Mr. Wilbur Raymond, at 11a, Belgrave\nSquare.\"\n\n\"I'll go to him tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you ever so much.\"\n\nGeorge got up. The movement seemed to put him in touch with the\nouter world. He noticed that the rain had stopped, and that stars\nhad climbed into the oblong of the doorway. He had an impression\nthat he had been in the barn a very long time; and confirmed this\nwith a glance at his watch, though the watch, he felt, understated",
        "the facts by the length of several centuries. He was abstaining\nfrom too close an examination of his emotions from a prudent\nfeeling that he was going to suffer soon enough without assistance\nfrom himself.\n\n\"I think you had better be going back,\" he said. \"It's rather late.\nThey may be missing you.\"\n\nMaud laughed happily.\n\n\"I don't mind now what they do. But I suppose dinners must be\ndressed for, whatever happens.\" They moved together to the door.",
        "\"What a lovely night after all! I never thought the rain would stop\nin this world. It's like when you're unhappy and think it's going\non for ever.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said George.\n\nMaud held out her hand.\n\n\"Good night, Mr. Bevan.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nHe wondered if there would be any allusion to the earlier passages\nof their interview. There was none. Maud was of the class whose\neducation consists mainly of a training in the delicate ignoring of\ndelicate situations.\n\n\"Then you will go and see Geoffrey?\"",
        "\"Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you ever so much.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\nGeorge admired her. The little touch of formality which she had\ncontrived to impart to the conversation struck just the right note,\ncreated just the atmosphere which would enable them to part without\nweighing too heavily on the deeper aspect of that parting.\n\n\"You're a real friend, Mr. Bevan.\"\n\n\"Watch me prove it.\"\n\n\"Well, I must rush, I suppose. Good night!\"\n\n\"Good night!\"\n\nShe moved off quickly across the field. Darkness covered her. The",
        "dog in the distance had begun to howl again. He had his troubles,\ntoo.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20.\n\nTrouble sharpens the vision. In our moments of distress we can see\nclearly that what is wrong with this world of ours is the fact that\nMisery loves company and seldom gets it. Toothache is an unpleasant\nailment; but, if toothache were a natural condition of life, if all\nmankind were afflicted with toothache at birth, we should not\nnotice it. It is the freedom from aching teeth of all those with",
        "whom we come in contact that emphasizes the agony. And, as with\ntoothache, so with trouble. Until our private affairs go wrong, we\nnever realize how bubbling over with happiness the bulk of mankind\nseems to be. Our aching heart is apparently nothing but a desert\nisland in an ocean of joy.\n\nGeorge, waking next morning with a heavy heart, made this discovery\nbefore the day was an hour old. The sun was shining, and birds sang\nmerrily, but this did not disturb him. Nature is ever callous to",
        "human woes, laughing while we weep; and we grow to take her\ncallousness for granted. What jarred upon George was the infernal\ncheerfulness of his fellow men. They seemed to be doing it on\npurpose--triumphing over him--glorying in the fact that, however\nFate might have shattered him, they were all right.\n\nPeople were happy who had never been happy before. Mrs. Platt, for\ninstance. A grey, depressed woman of middle age, she had seemed",
        "hitherto to have few pleasures beyond breaking dishes and relating\nthe symptoms of sick neighbours who were not expected to live\nthrough the week. She now sang. George could hear her as she\nprepared his breakfast in the kitchen. At first he had had a hope\nthat she was moaning with pain; but this was dispelled when he had\nfinished his toilet and proceeded downstairs. The sounds she\nemitted suggested anguish, but the words, when he was able to",
        "distinguish them, told another story. Incredible as it might seem,\non this particular morning Mrs. Platt had elected to be\nlight-hearted. What she was singing sounded like a dirge, but\nactually it was \"Stop your tickling, Jock!\" And, later, when she\nbrought George his coffee and eggs, she spent a full ten minutes\nprattling as he tried to read his paper, pointing out to him a\nnumber of merry murders and sprightly suicides which otherwise he",
        "might have missed. The woman went out of her way to show him that\nfor her, if not for less fortunate people, God this morning was in\nHis heaven and all was right in the world.\n\nTwo tramps of supernatural exuberance called at the cottage shortly\nafter breakfast to ask George, whom they had never even consulted\nabout their marriages, to help support their wives and children.\nNothing could have been more care-free and _debonnaire_ than the\ndemeanour of these men.",
        "And then Reggie Byng arrived in his grey racing car, more cheerful\nthan any of them.\n\nFate could not have mocked George more subtly. A sorrow's crown of\nsorrow is remembering happier things, and the sight of Reggie in\nthat room reminded him that on the last occasion when they had\ntalked together across this same table it was he who had been in a\nFool's Paradise and Reggie who had borne a weight of care. Reggie\nthis morning was brighter than the shining sun and gayer than the\ncarolling birds.",
        "\"Hullo-ullo-ullo-ullo-ullo-ullo-ul-lo! Topping morning, isn't it!\"\nobserved Reggie. \"The sunshine! The birds!  The absolute\nwhat-do-you-call-it of everything and so forth, and all that sort\nof thing, if you know what I mean! I feel like a two-year-old!\"\n\nGeorge, who felt older than this by some ninety-eight years,\ngroaned in spirit. This was more than man was meant to bear.\n\n\"I say,\" continued Reggie, absently reaching out for a slice of",
        "bread and smearing it with marmalade, \"this business of marriage,\nnow, and all that species of rot! What I mean to say is, what about\nit? Not a bad scheme, taking it by and large?  Or don't you think\nso?\"\n\nGeorge writhed. The knife twisted in the wound. Surely it was bad\nenough to see a happy man eating bread and marmalade without having\nto listen to him talking about marriage.\n\n\"Well, anyhow, be that as it may,\" said Reggie, biting jovially and",
        "speaking in a thick but joyous voice. \"I'm getting married today,\nand chance it. This morning, this very morning, I leap off the\ndock!\"\n\nGeorge was startled out of his despondency.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Absolutely, laddie!\"\n\nGeorge remembered the conventions.\n\n\"I congratulate you.\"\n\n\"Thanks, old man. And not without reason. I'm the luckiest fellow\nalive. I hardly knew I was alive till now.\"\n\n\"Isn't this rather sudden?\"\n\nReggie looked a trifle furtive. His manner became that of a\nconspirator.",
        "\"I should jolly well say it is sudden! It's got to be sudden.\nDashed sudden and deuced secret! If the mater were to hear of it,\nthere's no doubt whatever she would form a flying wedge and bust up\nthe proceedings with no uncertain voice. You see, laddie, it's Miss\nFaraday I'm marrying, and the mater--dear old soul--has other ideas\nfor Reginald. Life's a rummy thing, isn't it! What I mean to say\nis, it's rummy, don't you know, and all that.\"\n\n\"Very,\" agreed George.",
        "\"Who'd have thought, a week ago, that I'd be sitting in this jolly\nold chair asking you to be my best man? Why, a week ago I didn't\nknow you, and, if anybody had told me Alice Faraday was going to\nmarry me, I'd have given one of those hollow, mirthless laughs.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to be your best man?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, if you don't mind. You see,\" said Reggie\nconfidentially, \"it's like this. I've got lots of pals, of course,\nbuzzing about all over London and its outskirts, who'd be glad",
        "enough to rally round and join the execution-squad; but you know\nhow it is. Their maters are all pals of my mater, and I don't want\nto get them into trouble for aiding and abetting my little show, if\nyou understand what I mean. Now, you're different. You don't know\nthe mater, so it doesn't matter to you if she rolls around and puts\nthe Curse of the Byngs on you, and all that sort of thing. Besides,\nI don't know.\" Reggie mused.  \"Of course, this is the happiest day",
        "of my life,\" he proceeded, \"and I'm not saying it isn't, but you\nknow how it is--there's absolutely no doubt that a chappie does not\nshow at his best when he's being married. What I mean to say is,\nhe's more or less bound to look a fearful ass. And I'm perfectly\ncertain it would put me right off my stroke if I felt that some\nchump like Jack Ferris or Ronnie Fitzgerald was trying not to\ngiggle in the background. So, if you will be a sportsman and come",
        "and hold my hand till the thing's over, I shall be eternally\ngrateful.\"\n\n\"Where are you going to be married?\"\n\n\"In London. Alice sneaked off there last night. It was easy, as it\nhappened, because by a bit of luck old Marshmoreton had gone to\ntown yesterday morning--nobody knows why: he doesn't go up to\nLondon more than a couple of times a year. She's going to meet me\nat the Savoy, and then the scheme was to toddle round to the\nnearest registrar and request the lad to unleash the marriage",
        "service. I'm whizzing up in the car, and I'm hoping to be able to\npersuade you to come with me. Say the word, laddie!\"\n\nGeorge reflected. He liked Reggie, and there was no particular\nreason in the world why he should not give him aid and comfort in\nthis crisis. True, in his present frame of mind, it would be\ntorture to witness a wedding ceremony; but he ought not to let that\nstand in the way of helping a friend.\n\n\"All right,\" he said.",
        "\"Stout fellow! I don't know how to thank you. It isn't putting you\nout or upsetting your plans, I hope, or anything on those lines?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I had to go up to London today, anyway.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't get there quicker than in my car. She's a hummer.\nBy the way, I forgot to ask. How is your little affair coming\nalong? Everything going all right?\"\n\n\"In a way,\" said George. He was not equal to confiding his troubles\nto Reggie.",
        "\"Of course, your trouble isn't like mine was. What I mean is, Maud\nloves you, and all that, and all you've got to think out is a\nscheme for laying the jolly old family a stymie. It's a\npity--almost--that yours isn't a case of having to win the girl,\nlike me; because by Jove, laddie,\" said Reggie with solemn\nemphasis, \"I could help you there. I've got the thing down fine.\nI've got the infallible dope.\"\n\nGeorge smiled bleakly.\n\n\"You have? You're a useful fellow to have around. I wish you would",
        "tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"But you don't need it.\"\n\n\"No, of course not. I was forgetting.\"\n\nReggie looked at his watch.\n\n\"We ought to be shifting in a quarter of an hour or so. I don't\nwant to be late. It appears that there's a catch of some sort in\nthis business of getting married. As far as I can make out, if you\nroll in after a certain hour, the Johnnie in charge of the\nproceedings gives you the miss-in-baulk, and you have to turn up\nagain next day. However, we shall be all right unless we have a",
        "breakdown, and there's not much chance of that. I've been tuning up\nthe old car since seven this morning, and she's sound in wind and\nlimb, absolutely. Oil--petrol--water--air--nuts--bolts--sprockets--\ncarburetor--all present and correct. I've been looking after them\nlike a lot of baby sisters. Well, as I was saying, I've got the\ndope. A week ago I was just one of the mugs--didn't know a thing\nabout it--but now! Gaze on me, laddie! You see before you old",
        "Colonel Romeo, the Man who Knows! It all started on the night of\nthe ball. There was the dickens of a big ball, you know, to\ncelebrate old Boots' coming-of-age--to which, poor devil, he\ncontributed nothing but the sunshine of his smile, never having\nlearned to dance. On that occasion a most rummy and extraordinary\nthing happened. I got pickled to the eyebrows!\" He laughed happily.\n\"I don't mean that that was a unique occurrence and so forth,",
        "because, when I was a bachelor, it was rather a habit of mine to\nget a trifle submerged every now and again on occasions of decent\nmirth and festivity. But the rummy thing that night was that I\nshowed it. Up till then, I've been told by experts, I was a\nchappie in whom it was absolutely impossible to detect the\nsymptoms. You might get a bit suspicious if you found I couldn't\nmove, but you could never be certain. On the night of the ball,",
        "however, I suppose I had been filling the radiator a trifle too\nenthusiastically. You see, I had deliberately tried to shove\nmyself more or less below the surface in order to get enough nerve\nto propose to Alice. I don't know what your experience has been,\nbut mine is that proposing's a thing that simply isn't within the\nscope of a man who isn't moderately woozled. I've often wondered\nhow marriages ever occur in the dry States of America. Well, as I",
        "was saying, on the night of the ball a most rummy thing happened.\nI thought one of the waiters was you!\"\n\nHe paused impressively to allow this startling statement to sink\nin.\n\n\"And was he?\" said George.\n\n\"Absolutely not! That was the rummy part of it. He looked as like\nyou as your twin brother.\"\n\n\"I haven't a twin brother.\"\n\n\"No, I know what you mean, but what I mean to say is he looked just\nlike your twin brother would have looked if you had had a twin",
        "brother. Well, I had a word or two with this chappie, and after a\nbrief conversation it was borne in upon me that I was up to the\ngills. Alice was with me at the time, and noticed it too. Now you'd\nhave thought that that would have put a girl off a fellow, and all\nthat. But no. Nobody could have been more sympathetic. And she has\nconfided to me since that it was seeing me in my oiled condition\nthat really turned the scale. What I mean is, she made up her mind",
        "to save me from myself. You know how some girls are. Angels\nabsolutely!  Always on the look out to pluck brands from the\nburning, and what not. You may take it from me that the good seed\nwas definitely sown that night.\"\n\n\"Is that your recipe, then? You would advise the would-be\nbridegroom to buy a case of champagne and a wedding licence and get\nto work? After that it would be all over except sending out the\ninvitations?\"\n\nReggie shook his head.",
        "\"Not at all. You need a lot more than that. That's only the start.\nYou've got to follow up the good work, you see. That's where a\nnumber of chappies would slip up, and I'm pretty certain I should\nhave slipped up myself, but for another singularly rummy\noccurrence. Have you ever had a what-do-you-call it?  What's the\nword I want? One of those things fellows get sometimes.\"\n\n\"Headaches?\" hazarded George.\n\n\"No, no. Nothing like that. I don't mean anything you get--I mean",
        "something you get, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Measles?\"\n\n\"Anonymous letter. That's what I was trying to say. It's a most\nextraordinary thing, and I can't understand even now where the\ndeuce they came from, but just about then I started to get a whole\nbunch of anonymous letters from some chappie unknown who didn't\nsign his name.\"\n\n\"What you mean is that the letters were anonymous,\" said George.\n\n\"Absolutely. I used to get two or three a day sometimes. Whenever",
        "I went up to my room, I'd find another waiting for me on the\ndressing-table.\"\n\n\"Offensive?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Were the letters offensive? Anonymous letters usually are.\"\n\n\"These weren't. Not at all, and quite the reverse. They\ncontained a series of perfectly topping tips on how a fellow should\nproceed who wants to get hold of a girl.\"\n\n\"It sounds as though somebody had been teaching you ju-jitsu by\npost.\"\n\n\"They were great! Real red-hot stuff straight from the stable.",
        "Priceless tips like 'Make yourself indispensable to her in little\nways', 'Study her tastes', and so on and so forth. I tell you,\nladdie, I pretty soon stopped worrying about who was sending them\nto me, and concentrated the old bean on acting on them. They\nworked like magic. The last one came yesterday morning, and it was\na topper! It was all about how a chappie who was nervous should\nproceed. Technical stuff, you know, about holding her hand and",
        "telling her you're lonely and being sincere and straightforward and\nletting your heart dictate the rest. Have you ever asked for one\ncard when you wanted to fill a royal flush and happened to pick out\nthe necessary ace? I did once, when I was up at Oxford, and, by\nJove, this letter gave me just the same thrill. I didn't hesitate.\nI just sailed in. I was cold sober, but I didn't worry about that.\nSomething told me I couldn't lose. It was like having to hole out a",
        "three-inch putt. And--well, there you are, don't you know.\" Reggie\nbecame thoughtful. \"Dash it all! I'd like to know who the fellow\nwas who sent me those letters. I'd like to send him a\nwedding-present or a bit of the cake or something. Though I suppose\nthere won't be any cake, seeing the thing's taking place at a\nregistrar's.\"\n\n\"You could buy a bun,\" suggested George.\n\n\"Well, I shall never know, I suppose. And now how about trickling",
        "forth? I say, laddie, you don't object if I sing slightly from time\nto time during the journey? I'm so dashed happy, you know.\"\n\n\"Not at all, if it's not against the traffic regulations.\"\n\nReggie wandered aimlessly about the room in an ecstasy.\n\n\"It's a rummy thing,\" he said meditatively, \"I've just remembered\nthat, when I was at school, I used to sing a thing called the\nwhat's-it's-name's wedding song. At house-suppers, don't you know,",
        "and what not. Jolly little thing. I daresay you know it. It starts\n'Ding dong! Ding dong!' or words to that effect, 'Hurry along! For\nit is my wedding-morning!' I remember you had to stretch out the\n'mor' a bit. Deuced awkward, if you hadn't laid in enough breath.\n'The Yeoman's Wedding-Song.' That was it. I knew it was some\nchappie or other's. And it went on 'And the bride in something or\nother is doing something I can't recollect.' Well, what I mean is,",
        "now it's my wedding-morning! Rummy, when you come to think of it,\nwhat? Well, as it's getting tolerable late, what about it? Shift\nho?\"\n\n\"I'm ready. Would you like me to bring some rice?\"\n\n\"Thank you, laddie, no. Dashed dangerous stuff, rice!  Worse than\nshrapnel. Got your hat? All set?\"\n\n\"I'm waiting.\"\n\n\"Then let the revels commence,\" said Reggie. \"Ding dong!  Ding\nDong! Hurry along! For it is my wedding-morning!  And the bride--\nDash it, I wish I could remember what the bride was doing!\"",
        "\"Probably writing you a note to say that she's changed her mind,\nand it's all off.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" exclaimed Reggie. \"Come on!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Reginald Byng, seated at a table in the corner of the\nRegent Grill-Room, gazed fondly into each other's eyes. George,\nseated at the same table, but feeling many miles away, watched them\nmoodily, fighting to hold off a depression which, cured for a while\nby the exhilaration of the ride in Reggie's racing-car (it had",
        "beaten its previous record for the trip to London by nearly twenty\nminutes), now threatened to return. The gay scene, the ecstasy of\nReggie, the more restrained but equally manifest happiness of his\nbride--these things induced melancholy in George. He had not wished\nto attend the wedding-lunch, but the happy pair seemed to be\nrevolted at the idea that he should stroll off and get a bite to\neat somewhere else.\n\n\"Stick by us, laddie,\" Reggie had said pleadingly, \"for there is",
        "much to discuss, and we need the counsel of a man of the world. We\nare married all right--\"\n\n\"Though it didn't seem legal in that little registrar's office,\"\nput in Alice.\n\n\"--But that, as the blighters say in books, is but a beginning, not\nan end. We have now to think out the most tactful way of letting\nthe news seep through, as it were, to the mater.\"\n\n\"And Lord Marshmoreton,\" said Alice. \"Don't forget he has lost his\nsecretary.\"",
        "\"And Lord Marshmoreton,\" amended Reggie. \"And about a million other\npeople who'll be most frightfully peeved at my doing the Wedding\nGlide without consulting them. Stick by us, old top. Join our\nsimple meal. And over the old coronas we will discuss many things.\"\n\nThe arrival of a waiter with dishes broke up the silent communion\nbetween husband and wife, and lowered Reggie to a more earthly\nplane. He refilled the glasses from the stout bottle that nestled",
        "in the ice-bucket--(\"Only this one, dear!\" murmured the bride in\na warning undertone, and \"All right darling!\" replied the dutiful\ngroom)--and raised his own to his lips.\n\n\"Cheerio! Here's to us all! Maddest, merriest day of all the glad\nNew Year and so forth. And now,\" he continued, becoming sternly\npractical, \"about the good old sequel and aftermath, so to speak,\nof this little binge of ours. What's to be done. You're a brainy\nsort of feller, Bevan, old man, and we look to you for suggestions.",
        "How would you set about breaking the news to mother?\"\n\n\"Write her a letter,\" said George.\n\nReggie was profoundly impressed.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you he would have some devilish shrewd scheme?\" he\nsaid enthusiastically to Alice. \"Write her a letter!  What could be\nbetter? Poetry, by Gad!\" His face clouded.  \"But what would you say\nin it? That's a pretty knotty point.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Be perfectly frank and straightforward. Say you are\nsorry to go against her wishes--\"",
        "\"Wishes,\" murmured Reggie, scribbling industrially on the back of\nthe marriage licence.\n\n\"--But you know that all she wants is your happiness--\"\n\nReggie looked doubtful.\n\n\"I'm not sure about that last bit, old thing. You don't know the\nmater!\"\n\n\"Never mind, Reggie,\" put in Alice. \"Say it, anyhow. Mr. Bevan is\nperfectly right.\"\n\n\"Right ho, darling! All right, laddie--'happiness'. And then?\"\n\n\"Point out in a few well-chosen sentences how charming Mrs. Byng\nis . . .\"",
        "\"Mrs. Byng!\" Reggie smiled fatuously. \"I don't think I ever heard\nanything that sounded so indescribably ripping. That part'll be\neasy enough. Besides, the mater knows Alice.\"\n\n\"Lady Caroline has seen me at the castle,\" said his bride\ndoubtfully, \"but I shouldn't say she knows me. She has hardly\nspoken a dozen words to me.\"\n\n\"There,\" said Reggie, earnestly, \"you're in luck, dear heart!  The\nmater's a great speaker, especially in moments of excitement. I'm",
        "not looking forward to the time when she starts on me. Between\nourselves, laddie, and meaning no disrespect to the dear soul, when\nthe mater is moved and begins to talk, she uses up most of the\nlanguage.\"\n\n\"Outspoken, is she?\"\n\n\"I should hate to meet the person who could out-speak her,\" said\nReggie.\n\nGeorge sought information on a delicate point.\n\n\"And financially? Does she exercise any authority over you in that\nway?\"\n\n\"You mean has the mater the first call on the family doubloons?\"",
        "said Reggie. \"Oh, absolutely not! You see, when I call her the\nmater, it's using the word in a loose sense, so to speak. She's my\nstep-mother really. She has her own little collection of pieces of\neight, and I have mine. That part's simple enough.\"\n\n\"Then the whole thing is simple. I don't see what you've been\nworrying about.\"\n\n\"Just what I keep telling him, Mr. Bevan,\" said Alice.\n\n\"You're a perfectly free agent. She has no hold on you of any\nkind.\"\n\nReggie Byng blinked dizzily.",
        "\"Why, now you put it like that,\" he exclaimed, \"I can see that I\njolly well am! It's an amazing thing, you know, habit and all that.\nI've been so accustomed for years to jumping through hoops and\nshamming dead when the mater lifted a little finger, that it\nabsolutely never occurred to me that I had a soul of my own. I give\nyou my honest word I never saw it till this moment.\"\n\n\"And now it's too late!\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nGeorge indicated Alice with a gesture. The newly-made Mrs. Byng\nsmiled.",
        "\"Mr. Bevan means that now you've got to jump through hoops and sham\ndead when I lift a little finger!\"\n\nReggie raised her hand to his lips, and nibbled at it gently.\n\n\"Blessums 'ittle finger! It shall lift it and have 'ums Reggie\njumping through. . . .\" He broke off and tendered George a manly\napology. \"Sorry, old top! Forgot myself for the moment. Shan't\noccur again! Have another chicken or an eclair or some soup or\nsomething!\"\n\nOver the cigars Reggie became expansive.",
        "\"Now that you've lifted the frightful weight of the mater off my\nmind, dear old lad,\" he said, puffing luxuriously, \"I find myself\nsurveying the future in a calmer spirit. It seems to me that the\nbest thing to do, as regards the mater and everybody else, is\nsimply to prolong the merry wedding-trip till Time the Great Healer\nhas had a chance to cure the wound. Alice wants to put in a week or\nso in Paris. . . .\"\n\n\"Paris!\" murmured the bride ecstatically.",
        "\"Then I would like to trickle southwards to the Riviera. . .\"\n\n\"If you mean Monte Carlo, dear,\" said his wife with gentle\nfirmness, \"no!\"\n\n\"No, no, not Monte Carlo,\" said Reggie hastily, \"though it's a\ngreat place. Air--scenery--and what not! But Nice and Bordighera\nand Mentone and other fairly ripe resorts. You'd enjoy them. And\nafter that . . . I had a scheme for buying back my yacht, the jolly\nold Siren, and cruising about the Mediterranean for a month or so. I",
        "sold her to a local sportsman when I was in America a couple of\nyears ago. But I saw in the paper yesterday that the poor old\nbuffer had died suddenly, so I suppose it would be difficult to get\nhold of her for the time being.\" Reggie broke off with a sharp\nexclamation.\n\n\"My sainted aunt!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\nBoth his companions were looking past him, wide-eyed. George\noccupied the chair that had its back to the door, and was unable to",
        "see what it was that had caused their consternation; but he deduced\nthat someone known to both of them must have entered the\nrestaurant; and his first thought, perhaps naturally, was that it\nmust be Reggie's \"mater\". Reggie dived behind a menu, which he held\nbefore him like a shield, and his bride, after one quick look, had\nturned away so that her face was hidden. George swung around, but\nthe newcomer, whoever he or she was, was now seated and\nindistinguishable from the rest of the lunchers.",
        "\"Who is it?\"\n\nReggie laid down the menu with the air of one who after a momentary\npanic rallies.\n\n\"Don't know what I'm making such a fuss about,\" he said stoutly. \"I\nkeep forgetting that none of these blighters really matter in the\nscheme of things. I've a good mind to go over and pass the time of\nday.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" pleaded his wife. \"I feel so guilty.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" asked George again. \"Your step-mother?\"\n\n\"Great Scott, no!\" said Reggie. \"Nothing so bad as that. It's old\nMarshmoreton.\"",
        "\"Lord Marshmoreton!\"\n\n\"Absolutely! And looking positively festive.\"\n\n\"I feel so awful, Mr. Bevan,\" said Alice. \"You know, I left the\ncastle without a word to anyone, and he doesn't know yet that there\nwon't be any secretary waiting for him when he gets back.\"\n\nReggie took another look over George's shoulder and chuckled.\n\n\"It's all right, darling. Don't worry. We can nip off secretly by\nthe other door. He's not going to stop us. He's got a girl with",
        "him! The old boy has come to life--absolutely!  He's gassing away\nsixteen to the dozen to a frightfully pretty girl with gold hair.\nIf you slew the old bean round at an angle of about forty-five,\nBevan, old top, you can see her. Take a look. He won't see you.\nHe's got his back to us.\"\n\n\"Do you call her pretty?\" asked Alice disparagingly.\n\n\"Now that I take a good look, precious,\" replied Reggie with\nalacrity, \"no! Absolutely not! Not my style at all!\"\n\nHis wife crumbled bread.",
        "\"I think she must know you, Reggie dear,\" she said softly.  \"She's\nwaving to you.\"\n\n\"She's waving to _me_,\" said George, bringing back the sunshine to\nReggie's life, and causing the latter's face to lose its hunted\nlook. \"I know her very well. Her name's Dore. Billie Dore.\"\n\n\"Old man,\" said Reggie, \"be a good fellow and slide over to their\ntable and cover our retreat. I know there's nothing to be afraid of\nreally, but I simply can't face the old boy.\"",
        "\"And break the news to him that I've gone, Mr. Bevan,\" added Alice.\n\n\"Very well, I'll say good-bye, then.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Bevan, and thank you ever so much.\"\n\nReggie shook George's hand warmly.\n\n\"Good-bye, Bevan old thing, you're a ripper. I can't tell you how\nbucked up I am at the sportsmanlike way you've rallied round. I'll\ndo the same for you one of these days. Just hold the old boy in\nplay for a minute or two while we leg it. And, if he wants us, tell",
        "him our address till further notice is Paris. What ho! What ho!\nWhat ho! Toodle-oo, laddie, toodle-oo!\"\n\nGeorge threaded his way across the room. Billie Dore welcomed him\nwith a friendly smile. The earl, who had turned to observe his\nprogress, seemed less delighted to see him. His weather-beaten face\nwore an almost furtive look. He reminded George of a schoolboy who\nhas been caught in some breach of the law.\n\n\"Fancy seeing you here, George!\" said Billie. \"We're always",
        "meeting, aren't we? How did you come to separate yourself from the\npigs and chickens? I thought you were never going to leave them.\"\n\n\"I had to run up on business,\" explained George. \"How are you, Lord\nMarshmoreton?\"\n\nThe earl nodded briefly.\n\n\"So you're on to him, too?\" said Billie. \"When did you get wise?\"\n\n\"Lord Marshmoreton was kind enough to call on me the other morning\nand drop the incognito.\"\n\n\"Isn't dadda the foxiest old thing!\" said Billie delightedly.",
        "\"Imagine him standing there that day in the garden, kidding us\nalong like that! I tell you, when they brought me his card last\nnight after the first act and I went down to take a slant at this\nLord Marshmoreton and found dadda hanging round the stage door, you\ncould have knocked me over with a whisk-broom.\"\n\n\"I have not stood at the stage-door for twenty-five years,\" said\nLord Marshmoreton sadly.\n\n\"Now, it's no use your pulling that Henry W. Methuselah stuff,\"",
        "said Billie affectionately. \"You can't get away with it. Anyone\ncan see you're just a kid. Can't they, George?\" She indicated the\nblushing earl with a wave of the hand. \"Isn't dadda the youngest\nthing that ever happened?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I told him myself.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton giggled. There is no other verb that describes\nthe sound that proceeded from him.\n\n\"I feel young,\" he admitted.\n\n\"I wish some of the juveniles in the shows I've been in,\" said",
        "Billie, \"were as young as you. It's getting so nowadays that one's\nthankful if a juvenile has teeth.\" She glanced across the room.\n\"Your pals are walking out on you, George. The people you were\nlunching with,\" she explained. \"They're leaving.\"\n\n\"That's all right. I said good-bye to them.\" He looked at Lord\nMarshmoreton. It seemed a suitable opportunity to break the news.\n\"I was lunching with Mr. and Mrs. Byng,\" he said.\n\nNothing appeared to stir beneath Lord Marshmoreton's tanned\nforehead.",
        "\"Reggie Byng and his wife, Lord Marshmoreton,\" added George.\n\nThis time he secured the earl's interest. Lord Marshmoreton\nstarted.\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"They are just off to Paris,\" said George.\n\n\"Reggie Byng is not married!\"\n\n\"Married this morning. I was best man.\"\n\n\"Busy little creature!\" interjected Billie.\n\n\"But--but--!\"\n\n\"You know his wife,\" said George casually. \"She was a Miss Faraday.\nI think she was your secretary.\"\n\nIt would have been impossible to deny that Lord Marshmoreton showed",
        "emotion. His mouth opened, and he clutched the tablecloth. But\njust what the emotion was George was unable to say till, with a\nsigh that seemed to come from his innermost being, the other\nexclaimed \"Thank Heaven!\"\n\nGeorge was surprised.\n\n\"You're glad?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm glad!\"\n\n\"It's a pity they didn't know how you were going to feel. It would\nhave saved them a lot of anxiety. I rather gathered they supposed\nthat the shock was apt to darken your whole life.\"",
        "\"That girl,\" said Lord Marshmoreton vehemently, \"was driving me\ncrazy. Always bothering me to come and work on that damned family\nhistory. Never gave me a moment's peace . . .\"\n\n\"I liked her,\" said George.\n\n\"Nice enough girl,\" admitted his lordship grudgingly. \"But a damned\nnuisance about the house; always at me to go on with the family\nhistory. As if there weren't better things to do with one's time\nthan writing all day about my infernal fools of ancestors!\"",
        "\"Isn't dadda fractious today?\" said Billie reprovingly, giving the\nEarl's hand a pat. \"Quit knocking your ancestors! You're very lucky\nto have ancestors. I wish I had. The Dore family seems to go back\nabout as far as the presidency of Willard Filmore, and then it kind\nof gets discouraged and quite cold. Gee! I'd like to feel that my\ngreat-great-great-grandmother had helped Queen Elizabeth with the\nrent. I'm strong for the fine old stately families of England.\"",
        "\"Stately old fiddlesticks!\" snapped the earl.\n\n\"Did you see his eyes flash then, George? That's what they call\naristocratic rage. It's the fine old spirit of the Marshmoretons\nboiling over.\"\n\n\"I noticed it,\" said George. \"Just like lightning.\"\n\n\"It's no use trying to fool us, dadda,\" said Billie. \"You know just\nas well as I do that it makes you feel good to think that, every\ntime you cut yourself with your safety-razor, you bleed blue!\"\n\n\"A lot of silly nonsense!\" grumbled the earl.\n\n\"What is?\"",
        "\"This foolery of titles and aristocracy. Silly fetish-worship!\nOne man's as good as another. . . .\"\n\n\"This is the spirit of '76!\" said George approvingly.\n\n\"Regular I.W.W. stuff,\" agreed Billie. \"Shake hands the President\nof the Bolsheviki!\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton ignored the interruption. There was a strange\nlook in his eyes. It was evident to George, watching him with close\ninterest, that here was a revelation of the man's soul; that\nthoughts, locked away for years in the other's bosom were crying",
        "for utterance.\n\n\"Damned silly nonsense! When I was a boy, I wanted to be\nan engine-driver. When I was a young man, I was a Socialist\nand hadn't any idea except to work for my living and make a\nname for myself. I was going to the colonies. Canada. The\nfruit farm was actually bought. Bought and paid for!\" He\nbrooded a moment on that long-lost fruit farm. \"My father was\na younger son. And then my uncle must go and break his neck\nhunting, and the baby, poor little chap, got croup or something",
        ". . . And there I was, saddled with the title, and all my plans\ngone up in smoke . . . Silly nonsense! Silly nonsense!\"\n\nHe bit the end of a cigar. \"And you can't stand up against it,\" he\nwent on ruefully. \"It saps you. It's like some damned drug. I\nfought against it as long as I could, but it was no use. I'm as big\na snob as any of them now. I'm afraid to do what I want to do.\nAlways thinking of the family dignity. I haven't taken a free step\nfor twenty-five years.\"",
        "George and Billie exchanged glances. Each had the uncomfortable\nfeeling that they were eavesdropping and hearing things not meant\nto be heard. George rose.\n\n\"I must be getting along now,\" he said. \"I've one or two\nthings to do. Glad to have seen you again, Billie. Is the show\ngoing all right?\"\n\n\"Fine. Making money for you right along.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Lord Marshmoreton.\"\n\nThe earl nodded without speaking. It was not often now that he\nrebelled even in thoughts against the lot which fate had thrust",
        "upon him, and never in his life before had he done so in words. He\nwas still in the grip of the strange discontent which had come upon\nhim so abruptly.\n\nThere was a silence after George had gone.\n\n\"I'm glad we met George,\" said Billie. \"He's a good boy.\" She spoke\nsoberly. She was conscious of a curious feeling of affection for\nthe sturdy, weather-tanned little man opposite her. The glimpse\nshe had been given of his inner self had somehow made him come\nalive for her.",
        "\"He wants to marry my daughter,\" said Lord Marshmoreton. A few\nmoments before, Billie would undoubtedly have replied to such a\nstatement with some jocular remark expressing disbelief that the\nearl could have a daughter old enough to be married. But now she\nfelt oddly serious and unlike her usual flippant self.\n\n\"Oh?\" was all she could find to say.\n\n\"She wants to marry him.\"\n\nNot for years had Billie Dore felt embarrassed, but she felt so",
        "now. She judged herself unworthy to be the recipient of these very\nprivate confidences.\n\n\"Oh?\" she said again.\n\n\"He's a good fellow. I like him. I liked him the moment we met. He\nknew it, too. And I knew he liked me.\"\n\nA group of men and girls from a neighbouring table passed on their\nway to the door. One of the girls nodded to Billie. She returned\nthe nod absently. The party moved on. Billie frowned down at the\ntablecloth and drew a pattern on it with a fork.",
        "\"Why don't you let George marry your daughter, Lord Marshmoreton?\"\n\nThe earl drew at his cigar in silence.\n\n\"I know it's not my business,\" said Billie apologetically,\ninterpreting the silence as a rebuff.\n\n\"Because I'm the Earl of Marshmoreton.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"No you don't,\" snapped the earl. \"You think I mean by that that I\nthink your friend isn't good enough to marry my daughter. You think\nthat I'm an incurable snob. And I've no doubt he thinks so, too,",
        "though I took the trouble to explain my attitude to him when we\nlast met. You're wrong. It isn't that at all. When I say 'I'm the\nEarl of Marshmoreton', I mean that I'm a poor spineless fool who's\nafraid to do the right thing because he daren't go in the teeth of\nthe family.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. What have your family got to do with it?\"\n\n\"They'd worry the life out of me. I wish you could meet my sister\nCaroline! That's what they've got to do with it. Girls in my",
        "daughter's unfortunate position have got to marry position or\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know about position, but when it comes to\nmoney--why, George is the fellow that made the dollar-bill famous.\nHe and Rockefeller have got all there is, except the little bit\nthey have let Andy Carnegie have for car-fare.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? He told me he worked for a living.\" Billie was\nbecoming herself again. Embarrassment had fled.\n\n\"If you call it work. He's a composer.\"\n\n\"I know. Writes tunes and things.\"",
        "Billie regarded him compassionately.\n\n\"And I suppose, living out in the woods the way that you do that\nyou haven't a notion that they pay him for it.\"\n\n\"Pay him? Yes, but how much? Composers were not rich men in my day.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't talk of 'your day' as if you telling the boys\ndown at the corner store about the good times they all had before\nthe Flood. You're one of the Younger Set and don't let me have to\ntell you again. Say, listen! You know that show you saw last night.",
        "The one where I was supported by a few underlings. Well, George\nwrote the music for that.\"\n\n\"I know. He told me so.\"\n\n\"Well, did he tell you that he draws three per cent of the gross\nreceipts? You saw the house we had last night. It was a fair\naverage house. We are playing to over fourteen thousand dollars a\nweek. George's little bit of that is--I can't do it in my head, but\nit's a round four hundred dollars. That's eighty pounds of your",
        "money. And did he tell you that this same show ran over a year in\nNew York to big business all the time, and that there are three\ncompanies on the road now? And did he mention that this is the\nninth show he's done, and that seven of the others were just as big\nhits as this one? And did he remark in passing that he gets\nroyalties on every copy of his music that's sold, and that at least\nten of his things have sold over half a million? No, he didn't,",
        "because he isn't the sort of fellow who stands around blowing about\nhis income. But you know it now.\"\n\n\"Why, he's a rich man!\"\n\n\"I don't know what you call rich, but, keeping on the safe side, I\nshould say that George pulls down in a good year, during the\nseason--around five thousand dollars a week.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton was frankly staggered.\n\n\"A thousand pounds a week! I had no idea!\"\n\n\"I thought you hadn't. And, while I'm boosting George, let me tell",
        "you another thing. He's one of the whitest men that ever happened.\nI know him. You can take it from me, if there's anything rotten in\na fellow, the show-business will bring it out, and it hasn't come\nout in George yet, so I guess it isn't there. George is all\nright!\"\n\n\"He has at least an excellent advocate.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm strong for George. I wish there were more like him . . .\nWell, if you think I've butted in on your private affairs\nsufficiently, I suppose I ought to be moving. We've a rehearsal",
        "this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Let it go!\" said Lord Marshmoreton boyishly.\n\n\"Yes, and how quick do you think they would let me go, if I did?\nI'm an honest working-girl, and I can't afford to lose jobs.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton fiddled with his cigar-butt.\n\n\"I could offer you an alternative position, if you cared to accept\nit.\"\n\nBillie looked at him keenly. Other men in similar circumstances had\nmade much the same remark to her. She was conscious of feeling a\nlittle disappointed in her new friend.",
        "\"Well?\" she said dryly. \"Shoot.\"\n\n\"You gathered, no doubt, from Mr. Bevan's conversation, that my\nsecretary has left me and run away and got married?  Would you like\nto take her place?\"\n\nIt was not easy to disconcert Billie Dore, but she was taken aback.\nShe had been expecting something different.\n\n\"You're a shriek, dadda!\"\n\n\"I'm perfectly serious.\"\n\n\"Can you see me at a castle?\"\n\n\"I can see you perfectly.\" Lord Marshmoreton's rather formal manner",
        "left him. \"Do please accept, my dear child. I've got to finish this\ndamned family history some time or other. The family expect me to.\nOnly yesterday my sister Caroline got me in a corner and bored me\nfor half an hour about it. I simply can't face the prospect of\ngetting another Alice Faraday from an agency. Charming girl,\ncharming girl, of course, but . . . but . . . well, I'll be damned\nif I do it, and that's the long and short of it!\"\n\nBillie bubbled over with laughter.",
        "\"Of all the impulsive kids!\" she gurgled. \"I never met anyone like\nyou, dadda! You don't even know that I can use a typewriter.\"\n\n\"I do. Mr. Bevan told me you were an excellent stenographer.\"\n\n\"So George has been boosting me, too, has he?\" She mused.  \"I must\nsay, I'd love to come. That old place got me when I saw it that day.\"\n\n\"That's settled, then,\" said Lord Marshmoreton masterfully.  \"Go to\nthe theatre and tell them--tell whatever is usual in these cases.",
        "And then go home and pack, and meet me at Waterloo at six o'clock.\nThe train leaves at six-fifteen.\"\n\n\"Return of the wanderer, accompanied by dizzy blonde!  You've\ncertainly got it all fixed, haven't you! Do you think the family\nwill stand for me?\"\n\n\"Damn the family!\" said Lord Marshmoreton, stoutly.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" said Billie complacently, eyeing her\nreflection in the mirror of her vanity-case, \"I may glitter in the\nfighting-top, but it is genuine. When I was a kid, I was a regular",
        "little tow-head.\"\n\n\"I never supposed for a moment that it was anything but\ngenuine.\"\n\n\"Then you've got a fine, unsuspicious nature, dadda, and I admire\nyou for it.\"\n\n\"Six o'clock at Waterloo,\" said the earl. \"I will be waiting for\nyou.\"\n\nBillie regarded him with affectionate admiration.\n\n\"Boys will be boys,\" she said. \"All right. I'll be there.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22.\n\n\"Young blighted Albert,\" said Keggs the butler, shifting his weight\nso that it distributed itself more comfortably over the creaking",
        "chair in which he reclined, \"let this be a lesson to you, young\nfeller me lad.\"\n\nThe day was a week after Lord Marshmoreton's visit to London, the\nhour six o'clock. The housekeeper's room, in which the upper\nservants took their meals, had emptied. Of the gay company which\nhad just finished dinner only Keggs remained, placidly digesting.\nAlbert, whose duty it was to wait on the upper servants, was moving\nto and fro, morosely collecting the plates and glasses. The boy was",
        "in no happy frame of mind. Throughout dinner the conversation at\ntable had dealt almost exclusively with the now celebrated\nelopement of Reggie Byng and his bride, and few subjects could have\nmade more painful listening to Albert.\n\n\"What's been the result and what I might call the upshot,\" said\nKeggs, continuing his homily, \"of all your making yourself so busy\nand thrusting of yourself forward and meddling in the affairs of\nyour elders and betters? The upshot and issue of it 'as been that",
        "you are out five shillings and nothing to show for it. Five\nshillings what you might have spent on some good book and improved\nyour mind! And goodness knows it wants all the improving it can\nget, for of all the worthless, idle little messers it's ever been\nmy misfortune to have dealings with, you are the champion. Be\ncareful of them plates, young man, and don't breathe so hard. You\n'aven't got hasthma or something, 'ave you?\"\n\n\"I can't breathe now!\" complained the stricken child.",
        "\"Not like a grampus you can't, and don't you forget it.\" Keggs\nwagged his head reprovingly. \"Well, so your Reggie Byng's gone and\neloped, has he! That ought to teach you to be more careful another\ntime 'ow you go gambling and plunging into sweepstakes. The idea of\na child of your age 'aving the audacity to thrust 'isself forward\nlike that!\"\n\n\"Don't call him my Reggie Byng! I didn't draw 'im!\"\n\n\"There's no need to go into all that again, young feller. You",
        "accepted 'im freely and without prejudice when the fair exchange\nwas suggested, so for all practical intents and purposes he is your\nReggie Byng. I 'ope you're going to send him a wedding-present.\"\n\n\"Well, you ain't any better off than me, with all your 'ighway\nrobbery!\"\n\n\"My what!\"\n\n\"You 'eard what I said.\"\n\n\"Well, don't let me 'ear it again. The idea! If you 'ad any\nobjections to parting with that ticket, you should have stated them",
        "clearly at the time. And what do you mean by saying I ain't any\nbetter off than you are?\"\n\n\"I 'ave my reasons.\"\n\n\"You think you 'ave, which is a very different thing. I suppose you\nimagine that you've put a stopper on a certain little affair by\nsurreptitiously destroying letters entrusted to you.\"\n\n\"I never!\" exclaimed Albert with a convulsive start that nearly\nsent eleven plates dashing to destruction.\n\n\"'Ow many times have I got to tell you to be careful of them",
        "plates?\" said Keggs sternly. \"Who do you think you are--a juggler\non the 'Alls, 'urling them about like that? Yes, I know all about\nthat letter. You thought you was very clever, I've no doubt. But\nlet me tell you, young blighted Albert, that only the other evening\n'er ladyship and Mr. Bevan 'ad a long and extended interview in\nspite of all your hefforts. I saw through your little game, and I\nproceeded and went and arranged the meeting.\"",
        "In spite of himself Albert was awed. He was oppressed by the sense\nof struggling with a superior intellect.\n\n\"Yes, you did!\" he managed to say with the proper note of\nincredulity, but in his heart he was not incredulous. Dimly, Albert\nhad begun to perceive that years must elapse before he could become\ncapable of matching himself in battles of wits with this\nmaster-strategist.\n\n\"Yes, I certainly did!\" said Keggs. \"I don't know what 'appened at",
        "the interview--not being present in person. But I've no doubt that\neverything proceeded satisfactorily.\"\n\n\"And a fat lot of good that's going to do you, when 'e ain't\nallowed to come inside the 'ouse!\"\n\nA bland smile irradiated the butler's moon-like face.\n\n\"If by 'e you're alloodin' to Mr. Bevan, young blighted Albert, let\nme tell you that it won't be long before 'e becomes a regular duly\ninvited guest at the castle!\"\n\n\"A lot of chance!\"",
        "\"Would you care to 'ave another five shillings even money on it?\"\n\nAlbert recoiled. He had had enough of speculation where the butler\nwas concerned. Where that schemer was allowed to get within reach\nof it, hard cash melted away.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Never you mind what I'm going to do. I 'ave my methods. All I\n'ave to say to you is that tomorrow or the day after Mr. Bevan\nwill be seated in our dining-'all with 'is feet under our table,",
        "replying according to his personal taste and preference, when I ask\n'im if 'e'll 'ave 'ock or sherry. Brush all them crumbs carefully\noff the tablecloth, young blighted Albert--don't shuffle your\nfeet--breathe softly through your nose--and close the door be'ind\nyou when you've finished!\"\n\n\"Oh, go and eat cake!\" said Albert bitterly. But he said\nit to his immortal soul, not aloud. The lad's spirit was broken.\n\nKeggs, the processes of digestion completed, presented himself",
        "before Lord Belpher in the billiard-room. Percy was alone. The\nhouse-party, so numerous on the night of the ball and on his\nbirthday, had melted down now to reasonable proportions. The\nsecond and third cousins had retired, flushed and gratified, to\nobscure dens from which they had emerged, and the castle housed\nonly the more prominent members of the family, always harder to\ndislodge than the small fry. The Bishop still remained, and the",
        "Colonel. Besides these, there were perhaps half a dozen more of the\ncloser relations: to Lord Belpher's way of thinking, half a dozen\ntoo many. He was not fond of his family.\n\n\"Might I have a word with your lordship?\"\n\n\"What is it, Keggs?\"\n\nKeggs was a self-possessed man, but he found it a little hard to\nbegin. Then he remembered that once in the misty past he had seen\nLord Belpher spanked for stealing jam, he himself having acted on",
        "that occasion as prosecuting attorney; and the memory nerved him.\n\n\"I earnestly 'ope that your lordship will not think that I am\ntaking a liberty. I 'ave been in his lordship your father's service\nmany years now, and the family honour is, if I may be pardoned for\nsaying so, extremely near my 'eart. I 'ave known your lordship\nsince you were a mere boy, and . . .\"\n\nLord Belpher had listened with growing impatience to this preamble.\nHis temper was seldom at its best these days, and the rolling",
        "periods annoyed him.\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" he said. \"What is it?\"\n\nKeggs was himself now. In his opening remarks he had simply been,\nas it were, winding up. He was now prepared to begin.\n\n\"Your lordship will recall inquiring of me on the night of the ball\nas to the bona fides of one of the temporary waiters? The one that\nstated that 'e was the cousin of young bli--of the boy Albert, the\npage? I have been making inquiries, your lordship, and I regret to",
        "say I find that the man was a impostor. He informed me that 'e was\nAlbert's cousin, but Albert now informs me that 'e 'as no cousin in\nAmerica. I am extremely sorry this should have occurred, your\nlordship, and I 'ope you will attribute it to the bustle and haste\ninseparable from duties as mine on such a occasion.\"\n\n\"I know the fellow was an impostor. He was probably after the\nspoons!\"\n\nKeggs coughed.\n\n\"If I might be allowed to take a further liberty, your lordship,",
        "might I suggest that I am aware of the man's identity and of his\nmotive for visiting the castle.\"\n\nHe waited a little apprehensively. This was the crucial point in\nthe interview. If Lord Belpher did not now freeze him with a glance\nand order him from the room, the danger would be past, and he could\nspeak freely. His light blue eyes were expressionless as they met\nPercy's, but inwardly he was feeling much the same sensation as he\nwas wont to experience when the family was in town and he had",
        "managed to slip off to Kempton Park or some other race-course and\nput some of his savings on a horse. As he felt when the racing\nsteeds thundered down the straight, so did he feel now.\n\nAstonishment showed in Lord Belpher's round face. Just as it was\nabout to be succeeded by indignation, the butler spoke again.\n\n\"I am aware, your lordship, that it is not my place to offer\nsuggestions as to the private and intimate affairs of the family I",
        "'ave the honour to serve, but, if your lordship would consent to\noverlook the liberty, I think I could be of 'elp and assistance in\na matter which is causing annoyance and unpleasantness to all.\"\n\nHe invigorated himself with another dip into the waters of memory.\nYes. The young man before him might be Lord Belpher, son of his\nemployer and heir to all these great estates, but once he had seen\nhim spanked.\n\nPerhaps Percy also remembered this. Perhaps he merely felt that",
        "Keggs was a faithful old servant and, as such, entitled to thrust\nhimself into the family affairs. Whatever his reasons, he now\ndefinitely lowered the barrier.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, with a glance at the door to make sure that there\nwere no witnesses to an act of which the aristocrat in him\ndisapproved, \"go on!\"\n\nKeggs breathed freely. The danger-point was past.\n\n\"'Aving a natural interest, your lordship,\" he said, \"we of the\nServants' 'All generally manage to become respectfully aware of",
        "whatever 'appens to be transpirin' above stairs. May I say that I\nbecame acquainted at an early stage with the trouble which your\nlordship is unfortunately 'aving with a certain party?\"\n\nLord Belpher, although his whole being revolted against what\npractically amounted to hobnobbing with a butler, perceived that he\nhad committed himself to the discussion. It revolted him to think\nthat these delicate family secrets were the subject of conversation",
        "in menial circles, but it was too late to do anything now. And\nsuch was the whole-heartedness with which he had declared war upon\nGeorge Bevan that, at this stage in the proceedings, his chief\nemotion was a hope that Keggs might have something sensible to\nsuggest.\n\n\"I think, begging your lordship's pardon for making the remark,\nthat you are acting injudicious. I 'ave been in service a great\nnumber of years, startin' as steward's room boy and rising to my",
        "present position, and I may say I 'ave 'ad experience during those\nyears of several cases where the daughter or son of the 'ouse\ncontemplated a misalliance, and all but one of the cases ended\ndisastrously, your lordship, on account of the family trying\nopposition. It is my experience that opposition in matters of the\n'eart is useless, feedin', as it, so to speak, does the flame.\nYoung people, your lordship, if I may be pardoned for employing the",
        "expression in the present case, are naturally romantic and if you\nkeep 'em away from a thing they sit and pity themselves and want it\nall the more. And in the end you may be sure they get it. There's\nno way of stoppin' them. I was not on sufficiently easy terms with\nthe late Lord Worlingham to give 'im the benefit of my experience\non the occasion when the Honourable Aubrey Pershore fell in love\nwith the young person at the Gaiety Theatre. Otherwise I could",
        "'ave told 'im he was not acting judicious. His lordship opposed\nthe match in every way, and the young couple ran off and got\nmarried at a registrar's. It was the same when a young man who was\ntutor to 'er ladyship's brother attracted Lady Evelyn Walls, the\nonly daughter of the Earl of Ackleton. In fact, your lordship, the\nonly entanglement of the kind that came to a satisfactory\nconclusion in the whole of my personal experience was the affair of",
        "Lady Catherine Duseby, Lord Bridgefield's daughter, who\ninjudiciously became infatuated with a roller-skating instructor.\"\n\nLord Belpher had ceased to feel distantly superior to his companion.\nThe butler's powerful personality hypnotized him. Long ere the\nharangue was ended, he was as a little child drinking in the\nutterances of a master. He bent forward eagerly. Keggs had broken\noff his remarks at the most interesting point.\n\n\"What happened?\" inquired Percy.",
        "\"The young man,\" proceeded Keggs, \"was a young man of considerable\npersonal attractions, 'aving large brown eyes and a athletic\nlissome figure, brought about by roller-skating. It was no wonder,\nin the opinion of the Servants' 'All, that 'er ladyship should have\nfound 'erself fascinated by him, particularly as I myself 'ad 'eard\nher observe at a full luncheon-table that roller-skating was in\nher opinion the only thing except her toy Pomeranian that made life",
        "worth living. But when she announced that she had become engaged to\nthis young man, there was the greatest consternation. I was not, of\ncourse, privileged to be a participant at the many councils and\ndiscussions that ensued and took place, but I was aware that such\ntranspired with great frequency. Eventually 'is lordship took the\nshrewd step of assuming acquiescence and inviting the young man to\nvisit us in Scotland. And within ten days of his arrival, your",
        "lordship, the match was broken off. He went back to 'is\nroller-skating, and 'er ladyship took up visiting the poor and\neventually contracted an altogether suitable alliance by marrying\nLord Ronald Spofforth, the second son of his Grace the Duke of\nGorbals and Strathbungo.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\n\"Seein' the young man in the surroundings of 'er own 'ome, 'er\nladyship soon began to see that she had taken too romantic a view\nof 'im previous, your lordship. 'E was one of the lower middle",
        "class, what is sometimes termed the bourjoisy, and 'is 'abits were\nnot the 'abits of the class to which 'er ladyship belonged. 'E 'ad\nnothing in common with the rest of the 'ouse-party, and was\ninjudicious in 'is choice of forks. The very first night at dinner\n'e took a steel knife to the ontray, and I see 'er ladyship look at\nhim very sharp, as much as to say that scales had fallen from 'er\neyes. It didn't take 'er long after that to become convinced that\n'er 'eart 'ad led 'er astray.\"",
        "\"Then you think--?\"\n\n\"It is not for me to presume to offer anything but the most\nrespectful advice, your lordship, but I should most certainly\nadvocate a similar procedure in the present instance.\"\n\nLord Belpher reflected. Recent events had brought home to him the\nmagnitude of the task he had assumed when he had appointed himself\nthe watcher of his sister's movements. The affair of the curate and\nthe village blacksmith had shaken him both physically and",
        "spiritually. His feet were still sore, and his confidence in\nhimself had waned considerably. The thought of having to continue\nhis espionage indefinitely was not a pleasant one. How much simpler\nand more effective it would be to adopt the suggestion which had\nbeen offered to him.\n\n\"--I'm not sure you aren't right, Keggs.\"\n\n\"Thank you, your lordship.

        "\"Young blighted Albert,\" said Keggs crisply, shortly after\nbreakfast on the following morning, \"you're to take this note to\nMr. Bevan at the cottage down by Platt's farm, and you're to\ndeliver it without playing any of your monkey-tricks, and you're to\nwait for an answer, and you're to bring that answer back to me,\ntoo, and to Lord Marshmoreton. And I may tell you, to save you the\ntrouble of opening it with steam from the kitchen kettle, that I",
        "'ave already done so. It's an invitation to dine with us tonight.\nSo now you know. Look slippy!\"\n\nAlbert capitulated. For the first time in his life he felt humble.\nHe perceived how misguided he had been ever to suppose that he\ncould pit his pigmy wits against this smooth-faced worker of\nwonders.\n\n\"Crikey!\" he ejaculated.\n\nIt was all that he could say.\n\n\"And there's one more thing, young feller me lad,\" added Keggs\nearnestly, \"don't you ever grow up to be such a fat'ead as our",

From the cradle to the grave we alternate between\nthe Sargasso Sea and the rapids--forever either becalmed or\nstorm-tossed. It seemed to Maud, as she looked across the\ndinner-table in order to make sure for the twentieth time that it\nreally was George Bevan who sat opposite her, that, after months in",
        "which nothing whatever had happened, she was now living through a\nperiod when everything was happening at once. Life, from being a\nbroken-down machine, had suddenly begun to race.\n\nTo the orderly routine that stretched back to the time when she had\nbeen hurried home in disgrace from Wales there had succeeded a mad\nwhirl of events, to which the miracle of tonight had come as a\nfitting climax. She had not begun to dress for dinner till somewhat",
        "late, and had consequently entered the drawing-room just as Keggs\nwas announcing that the meal was ready. She had received her first\nshock when the love-sick Plummer, emerging from a mixed crowd of\nrelatives and friends, had informed her that he was to take her in.\nShe had not expected Plummer to be there, though he lived in the\nneighbourhood. Plummer, at their last meeting, had stated his\nintention of going abroad for a bit to mend his bruised heart: and",
        "it was a little disconcerting to a sensitive girl to find her\nvictim popping up again like this. She did not know that, as far as\nPlummer was concerned, the whole affair was to be considered opened\nagain. To Plummer, analysing the girl's motives in refusing him,\nthere had come the idea that there was Another, and that this other\nmust be Reggie Byng. From the first he had always looked upon\nReggie as his worst rival. And now Reggie had bolted with the",
        "Faraday girl, leaving Maud in excellent condition, so it seemed to\nPlummer, to console herself with a worthier man. Plummer knew all\nabout the Rebound and the part it plays in the affairs of the\nheart. His own breach-of-promise case two years earlier had been\nentirely due to the fact that the refusal of the youngest Devenish\ngirl to marry him had caused him to rebound into the dangerous\nsociety of the second girl from the O.P. end of the first row in",
        "the \"Summertime is Kissing-time\" number in the Alhambra revue. He\nhad come to the castle tonight gloomy, but not without hope.\n\nMaud's second shock eclipsed the first entirely. No notification\nhad been given to her either by her father or by Percy of the\nproposed extension of the hand of hospitality to George, and the\nsight of him standing there talking to her aunt Caroline made her\nmomentarily dizzy. Life, which for several days had had all the",
        "properties now of a dream, now of a nightmare, became more unreal\nthan ever. She could conceive no explanation of George's presence.\nHe could not be there--that was all there was to it; yet there\nundoubtedly he was. Her manner, as she accompanied Plummer down the\nstairs, took on such a dazed sweetness that her escort felt that in\ncoming there that night he had done the wisest act of a lifetime\nstudded but sparsely with wise acts. It seemed to Plummer that this",
        "girl had softened towards him. Certainly something had changed her.\nHe could not know that she was merely wondering if she was awake.\n\nGeorge, meanwhile, across the table, was also having a little\ndifficulty in adjusting his faculties to the progress of events. He\nhad given up trying to imagine why he had been invited to this\ndinner, and was now endeavouring to find some theory which would\nsquare with the fact of Billie Dore being at the castle. At",
        "precisely this hour Billie, by rights, should have been putting the\nfinishing touches on her make-up in a second-floor dressing-room at\nthe Regal. Yet there she sat, very much at her ease in this\naristocratic company, so quietly and unobtrusively dressed in some\nblack stuff that at first he had scarcely recognized her. She was\ntalking to the Bishop. . .\n\nThe voice of Keggs at his elbow broke in on his reverie.\n\n\"Sherry or 'ock, sir?\"",
        "George could not have explained why this reminder of the butler's\npresence should have made him feel better, but it did. There was\nsomething solid and tranquilizing about Keggs. He had noticed it\nbefore. For the first time the sensation of having been smitten\nover the head with some blunt instrument began to abate. It was as\nif Keggs by the mere intonation of his voice had said, \"All this\nno doubt seems very strange and unusual to you, but feel no alarm!\nI am here!\"",
        "George began to sit up and take notice. A cloud seemed to have\ncleared from his brain. He found himself looking on his\nfellow-diners as individuals rather than as a confused mass. The\nprophet Daniel, after the initial embarrassment of finding himself\nin the society of the lions had passed away, must have experienced\na somewhat similar sensation.\n\nHe began to sort these people out and label them. There had been\nintroductions in the drawing-room, but they had left him with a",
        "bewildered sense of having heard somebody recite a page from\nBurke's peerage. Not since that day in the free library in London,\nwhen he had dived into that fascinating volume in order to discover\nMaud's identity, had he undergone such a rain of titles. He now\ntook stock, to ascertain how many of these people he could\nidentify.\n\nThe stock-taking was an absolute failure. Of all those present the\nonly individuals he could swear to were his own personal little",
        "playmates with whom he had sported in other surroundings. There was\nLord Belpher, for instance, eyeing him with a hostility that could\nhardly be called veiled. There was Lord Marshmoreton at the head of\nthe table, listening glumly to the conversation of a stout woman\nwith a pearl necklace, but who was that woman? Was it Lady Jane\nAllenby or Lady Edith Wade-Beverly or Lady Patricia Fowles? And\nwho, above all, was the pie-faced fellow with the moustache talking\nto Maud?",
        "He sought assistance from the girl he had taken in to dinner. She\nappeared, as far as he could ascertain from a short acquaintance,\nto be an amiable little thing. She was small and young and fluffy,\nand he had caught enough of her name at the moment of introduction\nto gather that she was plain \"Miss\" Something--a fact which seemed\nto him to draw them together.\n\n\"I wish you would tell me who some of these people are,\" he said,\nas she turned from talking to the man on her other-side.  \"Who is",
        "the man over there?\"\n\n\"Which man?\"\n\n\"The one talking to Lady Maud. The fellow whose face ought to be\nshuffled and dealt again.\"\n\n\"That's my brother.\"\n\nThat held George during the soup.\n\n\"I'm sorry about your brother,\" he said rallying with the fish.\n\n\"That's very sweet of you.\"\n\n\"It was the light that deceived me. Now that I look again, I see\nthat his face has great charm.\"\n\nThe girl giggled. George began to feel better.\n\n\"Who are some of the others? I didn't get your name, for instance.",
        "They shot it at me so quick that it had whizzed by before I could\ncatch it.\"\n\n\"My name is Plummer.\"\n\nGeorge was electrified. He looked across the table with more vivid\ninterest. The amorous Plummer had been just a Voice to him till\nnow. It was exciting to see him in the flesh.\n\n\"And who are the rest of them?\"\n\n\"They are all members of the family. I thought you knew them.\"\n\n\"I know Lord Marshmoreton. And Lady Maud. And, of course, Lord",
        "Belpher.\" He caught Percy's eye as it surveyed him coldly from the\nother side of the table, and nodded cheerfully.  \"Great pal of\nmine, Lord Belpher.\"\n\nThe fluffy Miss Plummer twisted her pretty face into a grimace of\ndisapproval.\n\n\"I don't like Percy.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I think he's conceited.\"\n\n\"Surely not? What could he have to be conceited about?\"\n\n\"He's stiff.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, that's how he strikes people at first. The first\ntime I met him, I thought he was an awful stiff. But you should see",
        "him in his moments of relaxation. He's one of those fellows you\nhave to get to know. He grows on you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but look at that affair with the policeman in London.\nEverybody in the county is talking about it.\"\n\n\"Young blood!\" sighed George. \"Young blood! Of course, Percy is\nwild.\"\n\n\"He must have been intoxicated.\"\n\n\"Oh, undoubtedly,\" said George.\n\nMiss Plummer glanced across the table.\n\n\"Do look at Edwin!\"\n\n\"Which is Edwin?\"\n\n\"My brother, I mean. Look at the way he keeps staring at Maud.",
        "Edwin's awfully in love with Maud,\" she rattled on with engaging\nfrankness. \"At least, he thinks he is. He's been in love with a\ndifferent girl every season since I came out. And now that Reggie\nByng has gone and married Alice Faraday, he thinks he has a chance.\nYou heard about that, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did hear something about it.\"\n\n\"Of course, Edwin's wasting his time, really. I happen to\nknow\"--Miss Plummer sank her voice to a whisper--\"I happen to know",
        "that Maud's awfully in love with some man she met in Wales last\nyear, but the family won't hear of it.\"\n\n\"Families are like that,\" agreed George.\n\n\"Nobody knows who he is, but everybody in the county knows all about\nit. Those things get about, you know. Of course, it's out of the\nquestion. Maud will have to marry somebody awfully rich or with a\ntitle. Her family's one of the oldest in England, you know.\"\n\n\"So I understand.\"\n\n\"It isn't as if she were the daughter of Lord Peebles, somebody",
        "like that.\"\n\n\"Why Lord Peebles?\"\n\n\"Well, what I mean to say is,\" said Miss Plummer, with a silvery\necho of Reggie Byng, \"he made his money in whisky.\"\n\n\"That's better than spending it that way,\" argued George.\n\nMiss Plummer looked puzzled. \"I see what you mean,\" she said a\nlittle vaguely. \"Lord Marshmoreton is so different.\"\n\n\"Haughty nobleman stuff, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you think this mysterious man in Wales hasn't a chance?\"\n\n\"Not unless he and Maud elope like Reggie Byng and Alice. Wasn't",
        "that exciting? Who would ever have suspected Reggie had the dash to\ndo a thing like that? Lord Marshmoreton's new secretary is very\npretty, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Which is she?\"\n\n\"The girl in black with the golden hair.\"\n\n\"Is she Lord Marshmoreton's secretary?\"\n\n\"Yes. She's an American girl. I think she's much nicer than Alice\nFaraday. I was talking to her before dinner. Her name is Dore. Her\nfather was a captain in the American army, who died without leaving",
        "her a penny. He was the younger son of a very distinguished family,\nbut his family disowned him because he married against their\nwishes.\"\n\n\"Something ought to be done to stop these families,\" said George.\n\"They're always up to something.\"\n\n\"So Miss Dore had to go out and earn her own living. It must have\nbeen awful for her, mustn't it, having to give up society.\"\n\n\"Did she give up society?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. She used to go everywhere in New York before her father",
        "died. I think American girls are wonderful. They have so much\nenterprise.\"\n\nGeorge at the moment was thinking that it was in imagination that\nthey excelled.\n\n\"I wish I could go out and earn my living,\" said Miss Plummer.\n\"But the family won't dream of it.\"\n\n\"The family again!\" said George sympathetically. \"They're a perfect\ncurse.\"\n\n\"I want to go on the stage. Are you fond of the theatre?\"\n\n\"Fairly.\"\n\n\"I love it. Have you seen Hubert Broadleigh in ''Twas Once in\nSpring'?\"",
        "\"I'm afraid I haven't.\"\n\n\"He's wonderful. Have you seen Cynthia Dane in 'A Woman's No'?\"\n\n\"I missed that one too.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you prefer musical pieces? I saw an awfully good musical\ncomedy before I left town. It's called 'Follow the Girl'. It's at\nthe Regal Theatre. Have you seen it?\"\n\n\"I wrote it.\"\n\n\"You--what!\"\n\n\"That is to say, I wrote the music.\"\n\n\"But the music's lovely,\" gasped little Miss Plummer, as if the\nfact made his claim ridiculous. \"I've been humming it ever since.\"",
        "\"I can't help that. I still stick to it that I wrote it.\"\n\n\"You aren't George Bevan!\"\n\n\"I am!\"\n\n\"But--\" Miss Plummer's voice almost failed here--\"But I've been\ndancing to your music for years! I've got about fifty of your\nrecords on the Victrola at home.\"\n\nGeorge blushed. However successful a man may be he can never get\nused to Fame at close range.\n\n\"Why, that tricky thing--you know, in the second act--is the\ndarlingest thing I ever heard. I'm mad about it.\"",
        "\"Do you mean the one that goes lumty-lumty-tum, tumty-tumty-tum?\"\n\n\"No the one that goes ta-rumty-tum-tum, ta-rumty-tum.\nYou know! The one about Granny dancing the shimmy.\"\n\n\"I'm not responsible for the words, you know,\" urged George\nhastily. \"Those are wished on me by the lyrist.\"\n\n\"I think the words are splendid. Although poor popper thinks its\nimproper, Granny's always doing it and nobody can stop her! I loved\nit.\" Miss Plummer leaned forward excitedly. She was an impulsive",
        "girl. \"Lady Caroline.\"\n\nConversation stopped. Lady Caroline turned.\n\n\"Yes, Millie?\"\n\n\"Did you know that Mr. Bevan was _the_ Mr. Bevan?\"\n\nEverybody was listening now. George huddled pinkly in his chair. He\nhad not foreseen this bally-hooing. Shadrach, Meschach and Abednego\ncombined had never felt a tithe of the warmth that consumed him. He\nwas essentially a modest young man.\n\n\"_The_ Mr. Bevan?\" echoed Lady Caroline coldly. It was painful to",
        "her to have to recognize George's existence on the same planet as\nherself. To admire him, as Miss Plummer apparently expected her to\ndo, was a loathsome task. She cast one glance, fresh from the\nrefrigerator, at the shrinking George, and elevated her\naristocratic eyebrows.\n\nMiss Plummer was not damped. She was at the hero-worshipping age,\nand George shared with the Messrs. Fairbanks, Francis X. Bushman,\nand one or two tennis champions an imposing pedestal in her Hall of\nFame.",
        "\"You know! George Bevan, who wrote the music of 'Follow the Girl'.\"\n\nLady Caroline showed no signs of thawing. She had not heard of\n'Follow the Girl'. Her attitude suggested that, while she admitted\nthe possibility of George having disgraced himself in the manner\nindicated, it was nothing to her.\n\n\"And all those other things,\" pursued Miss Plummer indefatigably.\n\"You must have heard his music on the Victrola.\"\n\n\"Why, of course!\"\n\nIt was not Lady Caroline who spoke, but a man further down the",
        "table. He spoke with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Of course, by Jove!\" he said. \"The Schenectady Shimmy, by Jove,\nand all that! Ripping!\"\n\nEverybody seemed pleased and interested. Everybody, that is to say,\nexcept Lady Caroline and Lord Belpher. Percy was feeling that he\nhad been tricked. He cursed the imbecility of Keggs in suggesting\nthat this man should be invited to dinner. Everything had gone\nwrong. George was an undoubted success. The majority of the",
        "company were solid for him. As far as exposing his unworthiness in\nthe eyes of Maud was concerned, the dinner had been a ghastly\nfailure. Much better to have left him to lurk in his infernal\ncottage. Lord Belpher drained his glass moodily. He was seriously\nupset.\n\nBut his discomfort at that moment was as nothing to the agony which\nrent his tortured soul a moment later. Lord Marshmoreton, who had\nbeen listening with growing excitement to the chorus of approval,",
        "rose from his seat. He cleared his throat. It was plain that Lord\nMarshmoreton had something on his mind.\n\n\"Er. . . .\" he said.\n\nThe clatter of conversation ceased once more--stunned, as it always\nis at dinner parties when one of the gathering is seen to have\nassumed an upright position. Lord Marshmoreton cleared his throat\nagain. His tanned face had taken on a deeper hue, and there was a\nlook in his eyes which seemed to suggest that he was defying",
        "something or somebody. It was the look which Ajax had in his eyes\nwhen he defied the lightning, the look which nervous husbands have\nwhen they announce their intention of going round the corner to bowl\na few games with the boys. One could not say definitely that Lord\nMarshmoreton looked pop-eyed. On the other hand, one could not\nassert truthfully that he did not. At any rate, he was manifestly\nembarrassed. He had made up his mind to a certain course of action",
        "on the spur of the moment, taking advantage, as others have done,\nof the trend of popular enthusiasm: and his state of mind was\nnervous but resolute, like that of a soldier going over the top.\nHe cleared his throat for the third time, took one swift glance at\nhis sister Caroline, then gazed glassily into the emptiness above\nher head.\n\n\"Take this opportunity,\" he said rapidly, clutching at the\ntable-cloth for support, \"take this opportunity of announcing the",
        "engagement of my daughter Maud to Mr. Bevan. And,\" he concluded\nwith a rush, pouring back into his chair, \"I should like you all to\ndrink their health!\"\n\nThere was a silence that hurt. It was broken by two sounds,\noccurring simultaneously in different parts of the room. One was a\ngasp from Lady Caroline. The other was a crash of glass.\n\nFor the first time in a long unblemished career Keggs the butler\nhad dropped a tray.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24.",
        "Out on the terrace the night was very still. From a steel-blue sky\nthe stars looked down as calmly as they had looked on the night of\nthe ball, when George had waited by the shrubbery listening to the\nwailing of the music and thinking long thoughts. From the dark\nmeadows by the brook came the cry of a corncrake, its harsh note\nsoftened by distance.\n\n\"What shall we do?\" said Maud. She was sitting on the stone seat\nwhere Reggie Byng had sat and meditated on his love for Alice",
        "Faraday and his unfortunate habit of slicing his approach-shots. To\nGeorge, as he stood beside her, she was a white blur in the\ndarkness. He could not see her face.\n\n\"I don't know!\" he said frankly.\n\nNor did he. Like Lady Caroline and Lord Belpher and Keggs, the\nbutler, he had been completely overwhelmed by Lord Marshmoreton's\ndramatic announcement. The situation had come upon him unheralded\nby any warning, and had found him unequal to it.",
        "A choking sound suddenly proceeded from the whiteness that was\nMaud. In the stillness it sounded like some loud noise. It jarred\non George's disturbed nerves.\n\n\"Please!\"\n\n\"I c-can't help it!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to cry about, really! If we think long enough, we\nshall find some way out all right. Please don't cry.\"\n\n\"I'm not crying!\" The choking sound became an unmistakable ripple of\nmirth. \"It's so absurd! Poor father getting up like that in front\nof everyone! Did you see Aunt Caroline's face?\"",
        "\"It haunts me still,\" said George. \"I shall never forget it. Your\nbrother didn't seem any too pleased, either.\"\n\nMaud stopped laughing.\n\n\"It's an awful position,\" she said soberly. \"The announcement will\nbe in the Morning Post the day after tomorrow. And then the letters\nof congratulation will begin to pour in. And after that the\npresents. And I simply can't see how we can convince them all that\nthere has been a mistake.\" Another aspect of the matter struck her.\n\"It's so hard on you, too.\"",
        "\"Don't think about me,\" urged George. \"Heaven knows I'd give the\nwhole world if we could just let the thing go on, but there's no\nuse discussing impossibilities.\" He lowered his voice.  \"There's no\nuse, either, in my pretending that I'm not going to have a pretty\nbad time. But we won't discuss that. It was my own fault. I came\nbutting in on your life of my own free will, and, whatever happens,\nit's been worth it to have known you and tried to be of service to\nyou.\"",
        "\"You're the best friend I've ever had.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you think that.\"\n\n\"The best and kindest friend any girl ever had. I wish . . .\"\nShe broke off. \"Oh, well. . .\"\n\nThere was a silence. In the castle somebody had begun to play the\npiano. Then a man's voice began to sing.\n\n\"That's Edwin Plummer,\" said Maud. \"How badly he sings.\"\n\nGeorge laughed. Somehow the intrusion of Plummer had removed the\ntension. Plummer, whether designedly and as a sombre commentary on",
        "the situation or because he was the sort of man who does sing that\nparticular song, was chanting Tosti's \"Good-bye\". He was giving to\nits never very cheery notes a wailing melancholy all his own. A dog\nin the stables began to howl in sympathy, and with the sound came a\ncurious soothing of George's nerves. He might feel broken-hearted\nlater, but for the moment, with this double accompaniment, it was\nimpossible for a man with humour in his soul to dwell on the deeper",
        "emotions. Plummer and his canine duettist had brought him to\nearth. He felt calm and practical.\n\n\"We'd better talk the whole thing over quietly,\" he said.  \"There's\ncertain to be some solution. At the worst you can always go to Lord\nMarshmoreton and tell him that he spoke without a sufficient grasp\nof his subject.\"\n\n\"I could,\" said Maud, \"but, just at present, I feel as if I'd\nrather do anything else in the world. You don't realize what it",
        "must have cost father to defy Aunt Caroline openly like that. Ever\nsince I was old enough to notice anything, I've seen how she\ndominated him. It was Aunt Caroline who really caused all this\ntrouble. If it had only been father, I could have coaxed him to let\nme marry anyone I pleased. I wish, if you possibly can, you would\nthink of some other solution.\"\n\n\"I haven't had an opportunity of telling you,\" said George, \"that I\ncalled at Belgrave Square, as you asked me to do. I went there",
        "directly I had seen Reggie Byng safely married.\"\n\n\"Did you see him married?\"\n\n\"I was best man.\"\n\n\"Dear old Reggie! I hope he will be happy.\"\n\n\"He will. Don't worry about that. Well, as I was saying, I called\nat Belgrave Square, and found the house shut up. I couldn't get any\nanswer to the bell, though I kept my thumb on it for minutes at a\ntime. I think they must have gone abroad again.\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't that. I had a letter from Geoffrey this morning. His",
        "uncle died of apoplexy, while they were in Manchester on a business\ntrip.\" She paused. \"He left Geoffrey all his money,\" she went on.\n\"Every penny.\"\n\nThe silence seemed to stretch out interminably. The music from the\ncastle had ceased. The quiet of the summer night was unbroken. To\nGeorge the stillness had a touch of the sinister. It was the\nghastly silence of the end of the world. With a shock he realized\nthat even now he had been permitting himself to hope, futile as he",
        "recognized the hope to be. Maud had told him she loved another man.\nThat should have been final. And yet somehow his indomitable\nsub-conscious self had refused to accept it as final. But this news\nended everything. The only obstacle that had held Maud and this man\napart was removed. There was nothing to prevent them marrying.\nGeorge was conscious of a vast depression. The last strand of the\nrope had parted, and he was drifting alone out into the ocean of\ndesolation.",
        "\"Oh!\" he said, and was surprised that his voice sounded very much\nthe same as usual. Speech was so difficult that it seemed strange\nthat it should show no signs of effort. \"That alters everything,\ndoesn't it.\"\n\n\"He said in his letter that he wanted me to meet him in London\nand--talk things over, I suppose.\"\n\n\"There's nothing now to prevent your going. I mean, now that your\nfather has made this announcement, you are free to go where you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I am.\"\n\nThere was another silence.",
        "\"Everything's so difficult,\" said Maud.\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.\"\n\n\"If you are thinking of me,\" said George, \"please don't. I know\nexactly what you mean. You are hating the thought of hurting my\nfeelings. I wish you would look on me as having no feelings. All I\nwant is to see you happy. As I said just now, it's enough for me to\nknow that I've helped you. Do be reasonable about it. The fact that\nour engagement has been officially announced makes no difference in",
        "our relations to each other. As far as we two are concerned, we\nare exactly where we were the last time we met. It's no worse for\nme now than it was then to know that I'm not the man you love, and\nthat there's somebody else you loved before you ever knew of my\nexistence. For goodness' sake, a girl like you must be used to\nhaving men tell her that they love her and having to tell them that\nshe can't love them in return.\"\n\n\"But you're so different.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. I'm just one of the crowd.\"",
        "\"I've never known anybody quite like you.\"\n\n\"Well, you've never known anybody quite like Plummer, I should\nimagine. But the thought of his sufferings didn't break your\nheart.\"\n\n\"I've known a million men exactly like Edwin Plummer,\" said Maud\nemphatically. \"All the men I ever have known have been like\nhim--quite nice and pleasant and negative. It never seemed to\nmatter refusing them. One knew that they would be just a little bit\npiqued for a week or two and then wander off and fall in love with",
        "somebody else. But you're different. You . . . matter.\"\n\n\"That is where we disagree. My argument is that, where your\nhappiness is concerned, I don't matter.\"\n\nMaud rested her chin on her hand, and stared out into the velvet\ndarkness.\n\n\"You ought to have been my brother instead of Percy,\" she said at\nlast. \"What chums we should have been! And how simple that would\nhave made everything!\"\n\n\"The best thing for you to do is to regard me as an honorary\nbrother. That will make everything simple.\"",

The door of the castle closed with a\nbang.\n\n\"I suppose I ought to be going in now,\" said Maud.\n\n\"I suppose so. And I ought to be there, too, politely making my\nfarewells.

As for Lord Marshmoreton himself, he\nlooked quite shrivelled.\n\nIt had not been an easy matter to bring her erring brother to bay.\nThe hunt had been in progress full ten minutes before she and Lord\nBelpher finally cornered the poor wretch.

I think you must be out of your mind. I can hardly\nbelieve even now that this appalling thing has happened. I am",
        "hoping that I shall wake up and find it is all a nightmare. How you\ncan have done such a thing, I cannot understand.\"\n\n\"Quite!\" said Lord Belpher.\n\nIf Lady Caroline was upset, there are no words in the language that\nwill adequately describe the emotions of Percy.\n\nFrom the very start of this lamentable episode in high life, Percy\nhad been in the forefront of the battle. It was Percy who had had\nhis best hat smitten from his head in the full view of all",
        "Piccadilly. It was Percy who had suffered arrest and imprisonment\nin the cause. It was Percy who had been crippled for days owing to\nhis zeal in tracking Maud across country. And now all his\nsufferings were in vain. He had been betrayed by his own father.\n\nThere was, so the historians of the Middle West tell us, a man of\nChicago named Young, who once, when his nerves were unstrung, put\nhis mother (unseen) in the chopping-machine, and canned her and",
        "labelled her \"Tongue\". It is enough to say that the glance of\ndisapproval which Percy cast upon his father at this juncture would\nhave been unduly severe if cast by the Young offspring upon their\nparent at the moment of confession.\n\nLord Marshmoreton had rallied from his initial panic. The spirit of\nrevolt began to burn again in his bosom. Once the die is cast for\nrevolution, there can be no looking back. One must defy, not\napologize. Perhaps the inherited tendencies of a line of ancestors",
        "who, whatever their shortcomings, had at least known how to treat\ntheir women folk, came to his aid. Possibly there stood by his side\nin this crisis ghosts of dead and buried Marshmoretons, whispering\nspectral encouragement in his ear--the ghosts, let us suppose, of\nthat earl who, in the days of the seventh Henry, had stabbed his\nwife with a dagger to cure her tendency to lecture him at night; or\nof that other earl who, at a previous date in the annals of the",
        "family, had caused two aunts and a sister to be poisoned apparently\nfrom a mere whim. At any rate, Lord Marshmoreton produced from\nsome source sufficient courage to talk back.\n\n\"Silly nonsense!\" he grunted. \"Don't see what you're making all\nthis fuss about. Maud loves the fellow. I like the fellow.\nPerfectly decent fellow. Nothing to make a fuss about. Why\nshouldn't I announce the engagement?\"\n\n\"You must be mad!\" cried Lady Caroline. \"Your only daughter and a\nman nobody knows anything about!\"",
        "\"Quite!\" said Percy.\n\nLord Marshmoreton seized his advantage with the skill of an adroit\ndebater.\n\n\"That's where you're wrong. I know all about him. He's a very rich\nman. You heard the way all those people at dinner behaved when they\nheard his name. Very celebrated man!  Makes thousands of pounds a\nyear. Perfectly suitable match in every way.\"\n\n\"It is not a suitable match,\" said Lady Caroline vehemently.  \"I\ndon't care whether this Mr. Bevan makes thousands of pounds a year",
        "or twopence-ha'penny. The match is not suitable. Money is not\neverything.\"\n\nShe broke off. A knock had come on the door. The door opened, and\nBillie Dore came in. A kind-hearted girl, she had foreseen that\nLord Marshmoreton might be glad of a change of subject at about\nthis time.\n\n\"Would you like me to help you tonight?\" she asked brightly.  \"I\nthought I would ask if there was anything you wanted me to do.\"\n\nLady Caroline snatched hurriedly at her aristocratic calm. She",
        "resented the interruption acutely, but her manner, when she spoke,\nwas bland.\n\n\"Lord Marshmoreton will not require your help tonight,\" she said.\n\"He will not be working.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" said Billie.\n\n\"Good night,\" said Lady Caroline.\n\nPercy scowled a valediction.\n\n\"Money,\" resumed Lady Caroline, \"is immaterial. Maud is in no\nposition to be obliged to marry a rich man. What makes the thing\nimpossible is that Mr. Bevan is nobody. He comes from nowhere. He\nhas no social standing whatsoever.\"",
        "\"Don't see it,\" said Lord Marshmoreton. \"The fellow's a thoroughly\ndecent fellow. That's all that matters.\"\n\n\"How can you be so pig-headed! You are talking like an imbecile.\nYour secretary, Miss Dore, is a nice girl. But how would you feel\nif Percy were to come to you and say that he was engaged to be\nmarried to her?\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Percy. \"Quite!\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton rose and moved to the door. He did it with a\ncertain dignity, but there was a strange hunted expression in his\neyes.",
        "\"That would be impossible,\" he said.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said his sister. \"I am glad that you admit it.\"\n\nLord Marshmoreton had reached the door, and was standing holding\nthe handle. He seemed to gather strength from its support.\n\n\"I've been meaning to tell you about that,\" he said.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About Miss Dore. I married her myself last Wednesday,\" said Lord\nMarshmoreton, and disappeared like a diving duck.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26.\n\nAt a quarter past four in the afternoon, two days after the",
        "memorable dinner-party at which Lord Marshmoreton had behaved with\nso notable a lack of judgment, Maud sat in Ye Cosy Nooke, waiting\nfor Geoffrey Raymond. He had said in his telegram that he would\nmeet her there at four-thirty: but eagerness had brought Maud to the\ntryst a quarter of an hour ahead of time: and already the sadness\nof her surroundings was causing her to regret this impulsiveness.\nDepression had settled upon her spirit. She was aware of something\nthat resembled foreboding.",
        "Ye Cosy Nooke, as its name will immediately suggest to those who\nknow their London, is a tea-shop in Bond Street, conducted by\ndistressed gentlewomen. In London, when a gentlewoman becomes\ndistressed--which she seems to do on the slightest provocation--she\ncollects about her two or three other distressed gentlewomen,\nforming a quorum, and starts a tea-shop in the West-End, which she\ncalls Ye Oak Leaf, Ye Olde Willow-Pattern, Ye Linden-Tree, or Ye",
        "Snug Harbour, according to personal taste. There, dressed in\nTyrolese, Japanese, Norwegian, or some other exotic costume, she\nand her associates administer refreshments of an afternoon with a\nproud languor calculated to knock the nonsense out of the cheeriest\ncustomer. Here you will find none of the coarse bustle and\nefficiency of the rival establishments of Lyons and Co., nor the\nglitter and gaiety of Rumpelmayer's. These places have an\natmosphere of their own. They rely for their effect on an",
        "insufficiency of light, an almost total lack of ventilation, a\nproperty chocolate cake which you are not supposed to cut, and the\nsad aloofness of their ministering angels. It is to be doubted\nwhether there is anything in the world more damping to the spirit\nthan a London tea-shop of this kind, unless it be another London\ntea-shop of the same kind.\n\nMaud sat and waited. Somewhere out of sight a kettle bubbled in an\nundertone, like a whispering pessimist. Across the room two",
        "distressed gentlewomen in fancy dress leaned against the wall.\nThey, too, were whispering. Their expressions suggested that they\nlooked on life as low and wished they were well out of it, like the\nbody upstairs. One assumed that there was a body upstairs. One\ncannot help it at these places. One's first thought on entering is\nthat the lady assistant will approach one and ask in a hushed voice\n\"Tea or chocolate?  And would you care to view the remains?\"",
        "Maud looked at her watch. It was twenty past four. She could\nscarcely believe that she had only been there five minutes, but the\nticking of the watch assured her that it had not stopped. Her\ndepression deepened. Why had Geoffrey told her to meet him in a\ncavern of gloom like this instead of at the Savoy?  She would have\nenjoyed the Savoy. But here she seemed to have lost beyond recovery\nthe first gay eagerness with which she had set out to meet the man\nshe loved.",
        "Suddenly she began to feel frightened. Some evil spirit, possibly\nthe kettle, seemed to whisper to her that she had been foolish in\ncoming here, to cast doubts on what she had hitherto regarded as\nthe one rock-solid fact in the world, her love for Geoffrey. Could\nshe have changed since those days in Wales?  Life had been so\nconfusing of late. In the vividness of recent happenings those days\nin Wales seemed a long way off, and she herself different from the",
        "girl of a year ago. She found herself thinking about George Bevan.\n\nIt was a curious fact that, the moment she began to think of George\nBevan, she felt better. It was as if she had lost her way in a\nwilderness and had met a friend. There was something so capable, so\nsoothing about George. And how well he had behaved at that last\ninterview. George seemed somehow to be part of her life. She could\nnot imagine a life in which he had no share. And he was at this",
        "moment, probably, packing to return to America, and she would never\nsee him again. Something stabbed at her heart. It was as if she\nwere realizing now for the first time that he was really going.\n\nShe tried to rid herself of the ache at her heart by thinking of\nWales. She closed her eyes, and found that that helped her to\nremember. With her eyes shut, she could bring it all back--that\nrainy day, the graceful, supple figure that had come to her out of",
        "the mist, those walks over the hills . . . If only Geoffrey would\ncome! It was the sight of him that she needed.\n\n\"There you are!\"\n\nMaud opened her eyes with a start. The voice had sounded like\nGeoffrey's. But it was a stranger who stood by the table. And not\na particularly prepossessing stranger. In the dim light of Ye Cosy\nNooke, to which her opening eyes had not yet grown accustomed, all\nshe could see of the man was that he was remarkably stout. She",
        "stiffened defensively. This was what a girl who sat about in\ntea-rooms alone had to expect.\n\n\"Hope I'm not late,\" said the stranger, sitting down and breathing\nheavily. \"I thought a little exercise would do me good, so I\nwalked.\"\n\nEvery nerve in Maud's body seemed to come to life simultaneously.\nShe tingled from head to foot. It was Geoffrey!\n\nHe was looking over his shoulder and endeavouring by snapping his\nfingers to attract the attention of the nearest distressed",
        "gentlewoman; and this gave Maud time to recover from the frightful\nshock she had received. Her dizziness left her; and, leaving, was\nsucceeded by a panic dismay. This couldn't be Geoffrey! It was\noutrageous that it should be Geoffrey! And yet it undeniably was\nGeoffrey. For a year she had prayed that Geoffrey might be given\nback to her, and the gods had heard her prayer. They had given her\nback Geoffrey, and with a careless generosity they had given her",
        "twice as much of him as she had expected. She had asked for the\nslim Apollo whom she had loved in Wales, and this colossal\nchangeling had arrived in his stead.\n\nWe all of us have our prejudices. Maud had a prejudice against fat\nmen. It may have been the spectacle of her brother Percy, bulging\nmore and more every year she had known him, that had caused this\nkink in her character. At any rate, it existed, and she gazed in\nsickened silence at Geoffrey. He had turned again now, and she was",
        "enabled to get a full and complete view of him. He was not merely\nstout. He was gross. The slim figure which had haunted her for a\nyear had spread into a sea of waistcoat. The keen lines of his face\nhad disappeared altogether. His cheeks were pink jellies.\n\nOne of the distressed gentlewomen had approached with a\nslow disdain, and was standing by the table, brooding on the\ncorpse upstairs. It seemed a shame to bother her.\n\n\"Tea or chocolate?\" she inquired proudly.",
        "\"Tea, please,\" said Maud, finding her voice.\n\n\"One tea,\" sighed the mourner.\n\n\"Chocolate for me,\" said Geoffrey briskly, with the air of one\ndiscoursing on a congenial topic. \"I'd like plenty of whipped\ncream. And please see that it's hot.\"\n\n\"One chocolate.\"\n\nGeoffrey pondered. This was no light matter that occupied him.\n\n\"And bring some fancy cakes--I like the ones with icing on\nthem--and some tea-cake and buttered toast. Please see there's\nplenty of butter on it.\"",
        "Maud shivered. This man before her was a man in whose lexicon there\nshould have been no such word as butter, a man who should have\ncalled for the police had some enemy endeavoured to thrust butter\nupon him.\n\n\"Well,\" said Geoffrey leaning forward, as the haughty ministrant\ndrifted away, \"you haven't changed a bit. To look at, I mean.\"\n\n\"No?\" said Maud.\n\n\"You're just the same. I think I\"--he squinted down at his\nwaistcoat--\"have put on a little weight. I don't know if you notice\nit?\"",
        "Maud shivered again. He thought he had put on a little weight, and\ndidn't know if she had noticed it! She was oppressed by the eternal\nmelancholy miracle of the fat man who does not realize that he has\nbecome fat.\n\n\"It was living on the yacht that put me a little out of condition,\"\nsaid Geoffrey. \"I was on the yacht nearly all the time since I saw\nyou last. The old boy had a Japanese cook and lived pretty high. It\nwas apoplexy that got him. We had a great time touring about. We",
        "were on the Mediterranean all last winter, mostly at Nice.\"\n\n\"I should like to go to Nice,\" said Maud, for something to say. She\nwas feeling that it was not only externally that Geoffrey had\nchanged. Or had he in reality always been like this, commonplace\nand prosaic, and was it merely in her imagination that he had been\nwonderful?\n\n\"If you ever go,\" said Geoffrey, earnestly, \"don't fail to lunch at\nthe Hotel Côte d'Azur. They give you the most amazing selection of",
        "hors d'oeuvres you ever saw. Crayfish as big as baby lobsters! And\nthere's a fish--I've forgotten it's name, it'll come back to\nme--that's just like the Florida pompano. Be careful to have it\nbroiled, not fried. Otherwise you lose the flavour. Tell the\nwaiter you must have it broiled, with melted butter and a little\nparsley and some plain boiled potatoes. It's really astonishing.\nIt's best to stick to fish on the Continent. People can say what",
        "they like, but I maintain that the French don't really understand\nsteaks or any sort of red meat. The veal isn't bad, though I prefer\nour way of serving it. Of course, what the French are real geniuses\nat is the omelet. I remember, when we put in at Toulon for coal, I\nwent ashore for a stroll, and had the most delicious omelet with\nchicken livers beautifully cooked, at quite a small, unpretentious\nplace near the harbour. I shall always remember it.\"",
        "The mourner returned, bearing a laden tray, from which she removed\nthe funeral bakemeats and placed them limply on the table. Geoffrey\nshook his head, annoyed.\n\n\"I particularly asked for plenty of butter on my toast!\" he said.\n\"I hate buttered toast if there isn't lots of butter. It isn't\nworth eating. Get me a couple of pats, will you, and I'll spread it\nmyself. Do hurry, please, before the toast gets cold. It's no good\nif the toast gets cold. They don't understand tea as a meal at",
        "these places,\" he said to Maud, as the mourner withdrew.  \"You have\nto go to the country to appreciate the real thing. I remember we\nlay off Lyme Regis down Devonshire way, for a few days, and I went\nand had tea at a farmhouse there. It was quite amazing! Thick\nDevonshire cream and home-made jam and cakes of every kind. This\nsort of thing here is just a farce. I do wish that woman would\nmake haste with that butter. It'll be too late in a minute.\"",
        "Maud sipped her tea in silence. Her heart was like lead within her.\nThe recurrence of the butter theme as a sort of _leit motif_ in her\ncompanion's conversation was fraying her nerves till she felt she\ncould endure little more. She cast her mind's eye back over the\nhorrid months and had a horrid vision of Geoffrey steadily\nabsorbing butter, day after day, week after week--ever becoming\nmore and more of a human keg. She shuddered.\n\nIndignation at the injustice of Fate in causing her to give her",
        "heart to a man and then changing him into another and quite\ndifferent man fought with a cold terror, which grew as she realized\nmore and more clearly the magnitude of the mistake she had made.\nShe felt that she must escape. And yet how could she escape? She\nhad definitely pledged herself to this man.  (\"Ah!\" cried Geoffrey\ngaily, as the pats of butter arrived.  \"That's more like it!\" He\nbegan to smear the toast. Maud averted her eyes.) She had told him",
        "that she loved him, that he was the whole world to her, that there\nnever would be anyone else. He had come to claim her. How could she\nrefuse him just because he was about thirty pounds overweight?\n\nGeoffrey finished his meal. He took out a cigarette. (\"No smoking,\nplease!\" said the distressed gentlewoman.) He put the cigarette\nback in its case. There was a new expression in his eyes now, a\ntender expression. For the first time since they had met Maud",
        "seemed to catch a far-off glimpse of the man she had loved in\nWales. Butter appeared to have softened Geoffrey.\n\n\"So you couldn't wait!\" he said with pathos.\n\nMaud did not understand.\n\n\"I waited over a quarter of an hour. It was you who were late.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that. I am referring to your engagement. I saw the\nannouncement in the Morning Post. Well, I hope you will let me\noffer you my best wishes. This Mr. George Bevan, whoever he is, is\nlucky.\"",
        "Maud had opened her mouth to explain, to say that it was all a\nmistake. She closed it again without speaking.\n\n\"So you couldn't wait!\" proceeded Geoffrey with gentle regret.\n\"Well, I suppose I ought not to blame you. You are at an age when\nit is easy to forget. I had no right to hope that you would be\nproof against a few months' separation. I expected too much. But it\nis ironical, isn't it! There was I, thinking always of those days",
        "last summer when we were everything to each other, while you had\nforgotten me--Forgotten me!\" sighed Geoffrey. He picked a fragment\nof cake absently off the tablecloth and inserted it in his mouth.\n\nThe unfairness of the attack stung Maud to speech. She looked back\nover the months, thought of all she had suffered, and ached with\nself-pity.\n\n\"I hadn't,\" she cried.\n\n\"You hadn't? But you let this other man, this George Bevan, make\nlove to you.\"\n\n\"I didn't! That was all a mistake.\"\n\n\"A mistake?\"",
        "\"Yes. It would take too long to explain, but . . .\" She stopped. It\nhad come to her suddenly, in a flash of clear vision, that the\nmistake was one which she had no desire to correct. She felt like\none who, lost in a jungle, comes out after long wandering into the\nopen air. For days she had been thinking confusedly, unable to\ninterpret her own emotions: and now everything had abruptly become\nclarified. It was as if the sight of Geoffrey had been the key to a",
        "cipher. She loved George Bevan, the man she had sent out of her\nlife for ever. She knew it now, and the shock of realization made\nher feel faint and helpless. And, mingled with the shock of\nrealization, there came to her the mortification of knowing that\nher aunt, Lady Caroline, and her brother, Percy, had been right\nafter all. What she had mistaken for the love of a lifetime had\nbeen, as they had so often insisted, a mere infatuation, unable to",
        "survive the spectacle of a Geoffrey who had been eating too much\nbutter and had put on flesh.\n\nGeoffrey swallowed his piece of cake, and bent forward.\n\n\"Aren't you engaged to this man Bevan?\"\n\nMaud avoided his eye. She was aware that the crisis had arrived,\nand that her whole future hung on her next words.\n\nAnd then Fate came to her rescue. Before she could speak, there was\nan interruption.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said a voice. \"One moment!\"",
        "So intent had Maud and her companion been on their own affairs that\nneither of them observed the entrance of a third party. This was a\nyoung man with mouse-coloured hair and a freckled, badly-shaven\nface which seemed undecided whether to be furtive or impudent. He\nhad small eyes, and his costume was a blend of the flashy and the\nshabby. He wore a bowler hat, tilted a little rakishly to one side,\nand carried a small bag, which he rested on the table between them.",
        "\"Sorry to intrude, miss.\" He bowed gallantly to Maud, \"but I want\nto have a few words with Mr. Spenser Gray here.\"\n\nMaud, looking across at Geoffrey, was surprised to see that his\nflorid face had lost much of its colour. His mouth was open, and\nhis eyes had taken a glassy expression.\n\n\"I think you have made a mistake,\" she said coldly. She disliked\nthe young man at sight. \"This is Mr. Raymond.\"\n\nGeoffrey found speech.\n\n\"Of course I'm Mr. Raymond!\" he cried angrily. \"What do you mean by",
        "coming and annoying us like this?\"\n\nThe young man was not discomposed. He appeared to be used to being\nunpopular. He proceeded as though there had been no interruption.\nHe produced a dingy card.\n\n\"Glance at that,\" he said. \"Messrs. Willoughby and Son, Solicitors.\nI'm son. The guv'nor put this little matter into my hands. I've\nbeen looking for you for days, Mr. Gray, to hand you this paper.\"\nHe opened the bag like a conjurer performing a trick, and brought",
        "out a stiff document of legal aspect. \"You're a witness, miss, that\nI've served the papers. You know what this is, of course?\" he said\nto Geoffrey. \"Action for breach of promise of marriage. Our client,\nMiss Yvonne Sinclair, of the Regal Theatre, is suing you for ten\nthousand pounds. And, if you ask me,\" said the young man with\ngenial candour, dropping the professional manner, \"I don't mind\ntelling you, I think it's a walk-over! It's the best little action",
        "for breach we've handled for years.\" He became professional again.\n\"Your lawyers will no doubt communicate with us in due course. And,\nif you take my advice,\" he concluded, with another of his swift\nchanges of manner, \"you'll get 'em to settle out of court, for,\nbetween me and you and the lamp-post, you haven't an earthly!\"\n\nGeoffrey had started to his feet. He was puffing with outraged\ninnocence.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean by this?\" he demanded. \"Can't you see",
        "you've made a mistake? My name is not Gray. This lady has told you\nthat I am Geoffrey Raymond!\"\n\n\"Makes it all the worse for you,\" said the young man imperturbably,\n\"making advances to our client under an assumed name. We've got\nletters and witnesses and the whole bag of tricks. And how about\nthis photo?\" He dived into the bag again. \"Do you recognize that,\nmiss?\"\n\nMaud looked at the photograph. It was unmistakably Geoffrey. And it\nhad evidently been taken recently, for it showed the later",
        "Geoffrey, the man of substance. It was a full-length photograph and\nacross the stout legs was written in a flowing hand the legend, \"To\nBabe from her little Pootles\". Maud gave a shudder and handed it\nback to the young man, just as Geoffrey, reaching across the table,\nmade a grab for it.\n\n\"I recognize it,\" she said.\n\nMr. Willoughby junior packed the photograph away in his bag, and\nturned to go.\n\n\"That's all for today, then, I think,\" he said, affably.",
        "He bowed again in his courtly way, tilted the hat a little more to\nthe left, and, having greeted one of the distressed gentlewomen who\nloitered limply in his path with a polite \"If you please, Mabel!\"\nwhich drew upon him a freezing stare of which he seemed oblivious,\nhe passed out, leaving behind him strained silence.\n\nMaud was the first to break it.\n\n\"I think I'll be going,\" she said.\n\nThe words seemed to rouse her companion from his stupor.\n\n\"Let me explain!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to explain.\"",
        "\"It was just a . . . it was just a passing . . . It was nothing\n. . . nothing.\"\n\n\"Pootles!\" murmured Maud.\n\nGeoffrey followed her as she moved to the door.\n\n\"Be reasonable!\" pleaded Geoffrey. \"Men aren't saints!\nIt was nothing! . . . Are you going to end . . . everything\n. . . just because I lost my head?\"\n\nMaud looked at him with a smile. She was conscious of an\noverwhelming relief. The dim interior of Ye Cosy Nooke no longer\nseemed depressing. She could have kissed this unknown \"Babe\" whose",
        "businesslike action had enabled her to close a regrettable chapter\nin her life with a clear conscience.\n\n\"But you haven't only lost your head, Geoffrey,\" she said.  \"You've\nlost your figure as well.\"\n\nShe went out quickly. With a convulsive bound Geoffrey started to\nfollow her, but was checked before he had gone a yard.\n\nThere are formalities to be observed before a patron can leave Ye\nCosy Nooke.\n\n\"If you please!\" said a distressed gentlewomanly voice.",
        "The lady whom Mr. Willoughby had addressed as Mabel--erroneously,\nfor her name was Ernestine--was standing beside him with a slip of\npaper.\n\n\"Six and twopence,\" said Ernestine.\n\nFor a moment this appalling statement drew the unhappy man's mind\nfrom the main issue.\n\n\"Six and twopence for a cup of chocolate and a few cakes?\" he\ncried, aghast. \"It's robbery!\"\n\n\"Six and twopence, please!\" said the queen of the bandits with\nundisturbed calm. She had been through this sort of thing before.",
        "Ye Cosy Nooke did not get many customers; but it made the most of\nthose it did get.\n\n\"Here!\" Geoffrey produced a half-sovereign. \"I haven't time to\nargue!\"\n\nThe distressed brigand showed no gratification. She had the air of\none who is aloof from worldly things. All she wanted was rest and\nleisure--leisure to meditate upon the body upstairs. All flesh is\nas grass. We are here today and gone tomorrow. But there, beyond\nthe grave, is peace.\n\n\"Your change?\" she said.\n\n\"Damn the change!\"",
        "\"You are forgetting your hat.\"\n\n\"Damn my hat!\"\n\nGeoffrey dashed from the room. He heaved his body through the door.\nHe lumbered down the stairs.\n\nOut in Bond Street the traffic moved up and the traffic moved down.\nStrollers strolled upon the sidewalks.\n\nBut Maud had gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27.\n\nIn his bedroom at the Carlton Hotel George Bevan was packing. That\nis to say, he had begun packing; but for the last twenty minutes he\nhad been sitting on the side of the bed, staring into a future",
        "which became bleaker and bleaker the more he examined it. In the\nlast two days he had been no stranger to these grey moods, and they\nhad become harder and harder to dispel. Now, with the steamer-trunk\nbefore him gaping to receive its contents, he gave himself up\nwhole-heartedly to gloom.\n\nSomehow the steamer-trunk, with all that it implied of partings and\nvoyagings, seemed to emphasize the fact that he was going out alone\ninto an empty world. Soon he would be on board the liner, every",
        "revolution of whose engines would be taking him farther away from\nwhere his heart would always be. There were moments when the\ntorment of this realization became almost physical.\n\nIt was incredible that three short weeks ago he had been a happy\nman. Lonely, perhaps, but only in a vague, impersonal way. Not\nlonely with this aching loneliness that tortured him now. What was\nthere left for him? As regards any triumphs which the future might",
        "bring in connection with his work, he was, as Mac the stage-door\nkeeper had said, \"blarzy\". Any success he might have would be but a\nstale repetition of other successes which he had achieved. He would\ngo on working, of course, but--. The ringing of the telephone bell\nacross the room jerked him back to the present. He got up with a\nmuttered malediction. Someone calling up again from the theatre\nprobably. They had been doing it all the time since he had announced",
        "his intention of leaving for America by Saturday's boat.\n\n\"Hello?\" he said wearily.\n\n\"Is that George?\" asked a voice. It seemed familiar, but all female\nvoices sound the same over the telephone.\n\n\"This is George,\" he replied. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Don't you know my voice?\"\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"You'll know it quite well before long. I'm a great talker.\"\n\n\"Is that Billie?\"\n\n\"It is not Billie, whoever Billie may be. I am female, George.\"\n\n\"So is Billie.\"",
        "\"Well, you had better run through the list of your feminine friends\ntill you reach me.\"\n\n\"I haven't any feminine friends.\"\n\n\"None?\"\n\n\"That's odd.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You told me in the garden two nights ago that you looked on me as\na pal.\"\n\nGeorge sat down abruptly. He felt boneless.\n\n\"Is--is that you?\" he stammered. \"It can't be--Maud!\"\n\n\"How clever of you to guess. George, I want to ask you one or two\nthings. In the first place, are you fond of butter?\"",
        "George blinked. This was not a dream. He had just bumped his knee\nagainst the corner of the telephone table, and it still hurt most\nconvincingly. He needed the evidence to assure himself that he was\nawake.\n\n\"Butter?\" he queried. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if you don't even know what butter means, I expect it's\nall right. What is your weight, George?\"\n\n\"About a hundred and eighty pounds. But I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" There was a silence at the other end of the wire.",
        "\"About thirteen stone,\" said Maud's voice. \"I've been doing it in\nmy head. And what was it this time last year?\"\n\n\"About the same, I think. I always weigh about the same.\"\n\n\"How wonderful! George!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"This is very important. Have you ever been in Florida?\"\n\n\"I was there one winter.\"\n\n\"Do you know a fish called the pompano?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"How do you mean? It's just a fish. You eat it.\"\n\n\"I know. Go into details.\"\n\n\"There aren't any details. You just eat it.\"",
        "The voice at the other end of the wire purred with approval.  \"I\nnever heard anything so splendid. The last man who mentioned pompano\nto me became absolutely lyrical about sprigs of parsley and melted\nbutter. Well, that's that. Now, here's another very important point.\nHow about wall-paper?\"\n\nGeorge pressed his unoccupied hand against his forehead.\nThis conversation was unnerving him.\n\n\"I didn't get that,\" he said.\n\n\"Didn't get what?\"\n\n\"I mean, I didn't quite catch what you said that time. It",
        "sounded to me like 'What about wall-paper?'\"\n\n\"It was 'What about wall-paper?' Why not?\"\n\n\"But,\" said George weakly, \"it doesn't make any sense.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it does. I mean, what about wall-paper for your den?\"\n\n\"My den?\"\n\n\"Your den. You must have a den. Where do you suppose you're going\nto work, if you don't? Now, my idea would be some nice quiet\ngrass-cloth. And, of course, you would have lots of pictures and\nbooks. And a photograph of me. I'll go and be taken specially. Then",
        "there would be a piano for you to work on, and two or three really\ncomfortable chairs. And--well, that would be about all, wouldn't\nit?\"\n\nGeorge pulled himself together.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said.\n\n\"Why do you say 'Hello'?\"\n\n\"I forgot I was in London. I should have said 'Are you there?'\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what does it all mean?\"\n\n\"What does what mean?\"\n\n\"What you've been saying--about butter and pompanos and wall-paper\nand my den and all that? I don't understand.\"",
        "\"How stupid of you! I was asking you what sort of wall-paper you\nwould like in your den after we were married and settled down.\"\n\nGeorge dropped the receiver. It clashed against the side of the\ntable. He groped for it blindly.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said.\n\n\"Don't say 'Hello!' It sounds so abrupt!\"\n\n\"What did you say then?\"\n\n\"I said 'Don't say Hello!'\"\n\n\"No, before that! Before that! You said something about getting\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't we going to get married? Our engagement is announced",
        "in the Morning Post.\"\n\n\"But--But--\"\n\n\"George!\" Maud's voice shook. \"Don't tell me you are going to jilt\nme!\" she said tragically. \"Because, if you are, let me know in\ntime, as I shall want to bring an action for breach of promise.\nI've just met such a capable young man who will look after the\nwhole thing for me. He wears a bowler hat on the side of his head\nand calls waitresses 'Mabel'. Answer 'yes' or 'no'. Will you marry\nme?\"\n\n\"But--But--how about--I mean, what about--I mean how about--?\"",
        "\"Make up your mind what you do mean.\"\n\n\"The other fellow!\" gasped George.\n\nA musical laugh was wafted to him over the wire.\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"Well, what about him?\" said George.\n\n\"Isn't a girl allowed to change her mind?\" said Maud.\n\nGeorge yelped excitedly. Maud gave a cry.\n\n\"Don't sing!\" she said. \"You nearly made me deaf.\"\n\n\"Have you changed your mind?\"\n\n\"Certainly I have!\"\n\n\"And you really think--You really want--I mean, you really\nwant--You really think--\"\n\n\"Don't be so incoherent!\"",
        "\"Maud!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Will you marry me?\"\n\n\"Of course I will.\"\n\n\"Gosh!\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I said Gosh! And listen to me, when I say Gosh, I mean Gosh! Where\nare you? I must see you. Where can we meet?  I want to see you! For\nHeaven's sake, tell me where you are. I want to see you! Where are\nyou? Where are you?\"\n\n\"I'm downstairs.\"\n\n\"Where? Here at the 'Carlton'?\"\n\n\"Here at the 'Carlton'!\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Quite alone.\"\n\n\"You won't be long!\" said George.",
        "He hung up the receiver, and bounded across the room to where his\ncoat hung over the back of a chair. The edge of the steamer-trunk\ncaught his shin.\n\n\"Well,\" said George to the steamer-trunk, \"and what are you butting\nin for? Who wants you, I should like to know!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.",
